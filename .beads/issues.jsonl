This eliminates ambiguity in queue messages that reference multiple entity types.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit test: generateId produces valid ULID with correct prefix\n- Unit test: generateId is monotonically increasing within same millisecond\n- Unit test: parseId extracts entity type and raw ULID\n- Unit test: isValidId accepts valid IDs, rejects malformed ones\n- Unit test: different entity types produce different prefixes\n\nMANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified.

This is the thin vertical slice that validates the consumer-grade UX premise -- the user clicks \"Connect Google\", completes OAuth consent, and sees their calendar events appear in T-Minus within 10 seconds.\n\n## What to implement\n\nA hosted onboarding page served by the API worker that:\n1. Renders a branded \"Connect your calendar\" screen with provider buttons (Google, Microsoft, Apple)\n2. On \"Connect Google\" click, initiates the existing OAuth flow (GET /oauth/google/start) with PKCE\n3. On callback, renders success state with account name and calendar list\n4.

Apple does not offer a REST API for Calendar -- CalDAV (RFC 4791) over HTTPS to caldav.icloud.com is the only supported integration path. This story builds the provider adapter that speaks CalDAV and maps Apple Calendar data into the existing ProviderDelta/CanonicalEvent pipeline.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **CalDAV client library** in packages/shared/src/providers/apple/:\n   - PROPFIND for calendar discovery (list user's calendars)\n   - REPORT with calendar-multiget for event retrieval\n   - PUT/DELETE for event mutation (write path)\n   - ctag/etag-based change detection for incremental sync\n   - iCalendar (RFC 5545) parsing to CanonicalEvent normalization\n\n2. **AppleAccountDO** (or extend AccountDO with provider-specific config):\n   - Store CalDAV credentials (app-specific password encrypted with AES-256-GCM per AD-2)\n   - Store ctag per calendar for incremental sync\n   - Store etag per event for conflict detection\n\n3. **Authentication flow**:\n   - Primary: Apple ID + app-specific password (generated at appleid.apple.com)\n   - Guide user through app-specific password creation with step-by-step instructions\n   - Validate credentials via PROPFIND before saving\n   - Future: Apple Sign In with OAuth (when/if Apple exposes calendar scopes)\n\n4. **Provider adapter interface** implementing the same contract as GoogleCalendarProvider and OutlookCalendarProvider:\n   - listCalendars(): CalendarInfo[]\n   - getDeltas(syncCursor): ProviderDelta[]\n   - applyWrite(WriteOp): WriteResult\n\n## Business rules enforced\n- BR-1: All provider credentials encrypted at rest (AD-2)\n- BR-2: CalDAV credentials never leave AccountDO boundary\n- BR-3: ctag/etag change detection provides incremental sync equivalent to Google's syncToken\n- BR-4: iCalendar VEVENT maps to CanonicalEvent with same fidelity as Google/Microsoft events\n\n## Why this matters\nThe ICP uses Apple Calendar for personal/family life. Without Apple support, T-Minus can only federate work calendars -- missing half the picture. The user's exact words: \"all my family life happens in the Apple account.\"\n\n## Scope\n- IN: CalDAV client, Apple provider adapter, credential storage, iCalendar parsing, incremental sync via ctag/etag\n- OUT: Apple Sign In OAuth (future), Apple Watch integration (Phase 5C already covers), push notifications via CalDAV (future)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: iCalendar VEVENT -\u003e CanonicalEvent normalization (10+ event variants)\n- Unit test: ctag/etag change detection logic\n- Unit test: CalDAV XML request/response parsing\n- Integration test: full sync cycle with mocked CalDAV server\n- Integration test: credential validation via PROPFIND\n- Integration test: incremental sync detects new/modified/deleted events\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. CalDAV client successfully connects to caldav.icloud.com with app-specific password\n2. Calendar discovery returns all user calendars via PROPFIND\n3. Event retrieval via REPORT returns full event data\n4. iCalendar VEVENT correctly maps to CanonicalEvent (title, time, location, attendees, recurrence)\n5. Incremental sync via ctag/etag detects new, modified, and deleted events\n6. Credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM envelope encryption per AD-2\n7.

Each step is a PROPFIND with increasing specificity. Apple's caldav.icloud.com follows this strictly.\n- ctag/etag change detection is CalDAV's equivalent of Google's syncToken. ctag is per-calendar (any change bumps it), etag is per-event. Two-phase: check ctag first, then diff etags if changed.\n- Apple Calendar app-specific passwords use HTTP Basic Auth, not OAuth. The credentials are encoded as base64(appleId:password) in the Authorization header.\n- iCalendar line folding (RFC 5545 Section 3.1) MUST be reversed before parsing properties. CRLF followed by space/tab is a continuation, not a new property.\n- Response constructor rejects status 204 with a non-null body in some runtimes. Mock 204 responses must use null body.\n- CalDAV does NOT support push notifications (unlike Google/Microsoft).

{"id":"TM-2o2.3","title":"Consumer-Grade Onboarding UI","description":"Build the production onboarding interface that guides non-technical users through connecting their first calendar account. This is not an admin panel -- it is the first thing a new user sees, and it must feel as simple as signing up for any modern SaaS product. The walking skeleton (Story 1) proved the flow works; this story makes it beautiful and foolproof.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **Welcome screen**: Clean, branded landing with three provider cards (Google, Microsoft, Apple). Each card shows the provider logo, a one-line description, and a \"Connect\" button. No jargon, no technical terms.\n\n2. **Provider-specific flows**:\n   - Google/Microsoft: Click -\u003e OAuth consent -\u003e auto-return -\u003e success (existing flow, polished UI)\n   - Apple: Click -\u003e guided modal explaining app-specific password -\u003e link to appleid.apple.com -\u003e input field for password -\u003e validation -\u003e success\n\n3. **Connection success state**: Each connected account shows:\n   - Provider icon + account email\n   - Number of calendars found\n   - Sync status (syncing / synced / error)\n   - \"Manage\" dropdown (rename, disconnect, re-authenticate)\n\n4. **Add another account**: After first account, prominent \"Add another account\" CTA. The flow loops back to provider selection. Progress indicator shows: \"2 of 5 accounts connected\" (or similar).\n\n5. **Completion screen**: \"You're all set\" with summary of connected accounts and link to calendar view.\n\n6. **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile. The ICP may onboard from their phone.\n\n## Design principles\n- Zero jargon: \"Connect your calendar\" not \"Authorize OAuth scope\"\n- Progressive disclosure: show only what's needed at each step\n- Instant feedback: loading states, success animations, error messages appear inline\n- Recoverable: every error state has a \"Try again\" or \"Get help\" action\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Onboarding UI for all three providers, success/error states, responsive layout, add-another flow\n- OUT: Calendar view itself (Phase 2C already built), account settings page (separate story), admin features\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: each provider card renders correctly\n- Unit test: Apple credential input validates format\n- Unit test: connection status component shows correct states\n- Integration test: full onboarding flow for each provider (mocked OAuth)\n- Integration test: multi-account flow (add 3 accounts sequentially)\n- Accessibility test: keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, color contrast\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Welcome screen renders three provider cards with logos and \"Connect\" buttons\n2. Google/Microsoft flow: click -\u003e OAuth -\u003e return to onboarding with success state in under 30 seconds\n3. Apple flow: guided modal walks user through app-specific password with visual instructions\n4. Connected accounts show email, calendar count, and live sync status\n5. \"Add another account\" flow works for 5+ accounts without page reload\n6. Responsive: usable on 375px mobile viewport\n7.

The ICP has 3-6 accounts -- if the browser crashes after connecting account #3, they should not have to redo those connections.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **Onboarding session**: A server-side record tracking:\n   - User ID\n   - Connected accounts (list of account IDs with provider and status)\n   - Onboarding step (welcome / connecting / complete)\n   - Created/updated timestamps\n   - Session token (stored in httpOnly cookie)\n\n2. **Session persistence**: Stored in UserGraphDO (per-user state). The onboarding session is just another piece of user state alongside calendar data.\n\n3. **Resume flow**: On page load, check for existing session:\n   - If session exists with connected accounts, show current state (skip welcome)\n   - If session is complete, redirect to calendar view\n   - If no session, start fresh\n\n4. **Cross-tab safety**: If user opens onboarding in two tabs, both tabs reflect the same state. Use a simple polling mechanism (GET /api/onboarding/status) rather than WebSocket for MVP.\n\n5. **Session cleanup**: Mark session complete when user clicks \"Done\" or navigates to calendar view. Do not auto-expire sessions -- the user may take days to add all their accounts.\n\n## Business rules enforced\n- BR-1: Onboarding session is per-user, stored in UserGraphDO\n- BR-2: OAuth state parameter includes session ID for correlation\n- BR-3: Session survives browser close (httpOnly cookie + server state)\n- BR-4: Adding an account is idempotent -- re-connecting same Google account updates rather than duplicates\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Session creation, persistence, resume, cross-tab polling, cleanup\n- OUT: Session analytics/telemetry (future), A/B testing of onboarding variants (future)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: session creation and serialization\n- Unit test: resume logic (existing session with N accounts)\n- Unit test: idempotent account addition (same account re-connected)\n- Integration test: session persists in UserGraphDO across requests\n- Integration test: OAuth callback correlates with session via state parameter\n- Integration test: cross-tab polling returns consistent state\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Onboarding session persists across browser close/reopen\n2. Resuming shows all previously connected accounts with correct status\n3. OAuth state parameter includes session ID for post-callback correlation\n4. Re-connecting the same account updates existing connection (no duplicates)\n5.

This story proves the entire epic works as an integrated whole by testing the full onboarding journey of a user with multiple accounts across all three providers. No mocks, no test fixtures -- real HTTP requests against deployed services (staging environment).\n\n## What to validate\n\n1. **Full onboarding journey**: \n   - New user lands on onboarding page\n   - Connects Google Workspace account (OAuth flow)\n   - Connects Microsoft 365 account (OAuth flow)\n   - Connects Apple iCloud account (CalDAV credentials)\n   - Sees all 3 accounts with \"Synced\" status\n   - Events from all 3 providers appear in unified view\n\n2. **Multi-account stress test**:\n   - Connect 5 accounts (3 Google + 1 Microsoft + 1 Apple) in a single session\n   - Verify no race conditions, no duplicate accounts, no lost state\n\n3. **Session resilience**:\n   - Connect 2 accounts, close browser, reopen\n   - Verify session resumes with 2 accounts shown\n   - Add 3rd account from resumed state\n\n4. **Error recovery**:\n   - Simulate OAuth denial, verify recovery path works\n   - Simulate invalid Apple password, verify retry works\n   - Simulate network timeout, verify auto-retry works\n\n5. **Account management**:\n   - View provider health dashboard with all accounts\n   - Disconnect one account, verify clean removal\n   - Reconnect the same account, verify no duplicates\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Full 3-provider onboarding completes in under 5 minutes (wall clock, not counting OAuth consent time)\n2. 5-account stress test produces no race conditions or duplicate accounts\n3. Session resume after browser close preserves all connected accounts\n4. Error recovery paths tested for OAuth denial, invalid credentials, and network timeout\n5.

These must be added to UserGraphDO before the workflow can be used in production. This is documented here rather than blocking because the integration tests use mock DOs at the fetch boundary -- the contract is defined but the DO implementation needs expansion.\n- Hash verification (AC7) recomputes projection + hash in the workflow itself using compileProjection/computeProjectionHash from @tminus/shared, then delegates the correction to recomputeProjections in UserGraphDO. This avoids duplicating the projection logic while still detecting mismatches at the reconciliation layer.\n- The logReconcileDiscrepancy endpoint is a non-fatal operation (console.error on failure) to ensure reconciliation continues even if journal writes fail.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [ISSUE] durable-objects/user-graph/src/index.ts: UserGraphDO.handleFetch() does not yet route /findCanonicalByOrigin, /getPolicyEdges, /getActiveMirrors, or /logReconcileDiscrepancy. These endpoints need to be added for ReconcileWorkflow to work in production.

Deploy all Phase 1 workers to a dev Cloudflare environment\n2. Using two real Google test accounts:\n   a. Connect Account A via OAuth flow\n   b. Connect Account B via OAuth flow\n   c. Verify OnboardingWorkflow completes for both\n   d. Verify default BUSY policy edges created (A\u003c-\u003eB)\n3. Create an event in Account A via Google Calendar UI\n4. Observe:\n   a. Webhook fires and is received by webhook-worker\n   b. SYNC_INCREMENTAL enqueued in sync-queue\n   c. sync-consumer fetches delta, calls UserGraphDO\n   d. UserGraphDO creates canonical event, enqueues UPSERT_MIRROR\n   e. write-consumer creates Busy block in Account B\n5. Verify in Account B's Google Calendar: 'External Busy' calendar contains the Busy block\n6. Verify no sync loop occurs\n\n## Demo format\n\nRecord or document:\n- Screen capture of event creation in Account A\n- Screen capture of Busy block appearing in Account B\n- Sync status endpoint showing healthy\n- Event journal showing the complete trace\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Real Google Calendar accounts used (not mocks)\n2. Event appears in Account B's overlay calendar\n3. Pipeline executes within 5 minutes (per BUSINESS.md Outcome 1 target)\n4.

This correctly handles events that touch slot boundaries (e.g., an event ending at exactly the slot start does NOT overlap).\n- The mcp_events table did not have a status column.

Pure function pattern -- drift computation and reputation scoring are both pure functions in shared/, making them trivially testable without DB/DO. This pattern should be standard for all business logic.\n2. Walking skeleton first -- TM-4wb.1 established the full vertical slice (DO tables + RPC + API routes + integration tests) which made all subsequent stories incremental additions.\n3. Parallel execution -- TM-4wb.3 and TM-4wb.5 ran in parallel with zero conflicts because they touched orthogonal code paths (scoring vs MCP wiring).\n4. E2E test pattern reuse -- The global fetch mock with route-based dispatch from e2e-validation.test.tsx was directly reusable for e2e-relationships.test.tsx.\n5. Schema forward stability -- relationships and interaction_ledger tables existed in V1 schema, so no migrations needed. CASCADE FKs auto-clean drift alerts.\n\nWHAT TO IMPROVE:\n1. Story bleed -- TM-4wb.2 agent bundled TM-4wb.4 changes (drift_alerts, DriftAlertRow types) ahead of schedule. This caused the TM-4wb.4 developer to find code already in HEAD. Not harmful but reduces traceability.\n2. Missing LEARNINGS sections -- TM-4wb.3 and TM-4wb.5 delivered without explicit LEARNINGS. The developer prompt should more strongly require this field.\n3. act() warnings accumulating -- Multiple test files (Billing, Governance, Scheduling) emit React act() warnings. Non-blocking but technical debt growing.\n4. Cron wrangler.toml drift -- TM-4wb.4 noted workers/cron/wrangler.toml missing WRITE_QUEUE and DELETION_WORKFLOW bindings. Runtime handlers reference them but they're not wired. Needs a bug ticket.\n\nACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FOR FUTURE PHASES:\n1. ENFORCE: Developer agents must include a LEARNINGS section in delivery notes. Add to story template.\n2. PATTERN: Pure functions in shared/ -\u003e DO methods that call them -\u003e API routes -\u003e MCP tools -\u003e UI. This layered approach worked cleanly for relationships and should be the standard for Phase 4B-4D.\n3.

Currently interaction detection requires explicit participant_hashes in the delta payload.\n4. BUG: File cron wrangler.toml binding gap as a standalone bug ticket.\n5.

It is NEVER treated as a new origin. The sync pipeline only checks for drift and corrects if needed.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nWithout correct classification, managed mirror events would be treated as new origin events, creating an infinite sync loop: A creates mirror in B, B's webhook fires, B's event is treated as origin, which creates a mirror back in A, and so on forever.

Call AccountDO.getAccessToken(target_account_id)\n2. Look up event_mirrors for existing provider_event_id via UserGraphDO\n3. If provider_event_id exists: PATCH the existing event via GoogleCalendarClient\n4. If no provider_event_id: INSERT new event into target busy overlay calendar\n5. The projected_payload includes extendedProperties with tminus/managed tags (loop prevention)\n6. Update event_mirrors: set provider_event_id, last_projected_hash, last_write_ts, state='ACTIVE'\n\n#### DELETE_MIRROR\n\n1. Call AccountDO.getAccessToken(target_account_id)\n2. Delete the event via GoogleCalendarClient.deleteEvent(provider_event_id)\n3. Update event_mirrors: set state='DELETED'\n\n### Busy overlay calendar auto-creation\n\nWhen inserting a mirror into an account for the first time, the target calendar might not exist yet. The write-consumer must:\n1. Check if the busy overlay calendar exists for the target account (stored in UserGraphDO calendars table)\n2. If not: create it via GoogleCalendarClient.insertCalendar('External Busy (T-Minus)')\n3. Store the new calendar_id in UserGraphDO calendars table with kind='BUSY_OVERLAY'\n4. Use this calendar_id for the insert\n\n### Idempotency (Invariant D)\n\n- Each message includes idempotency_key = hash(canonical_event_id + target_account_id + projected_hash)\n- Before writing, check if the mirror's last_projected_hash already matches the projected_hash in the message\n- If it matches, skip the write (already done, likely a retry)\n\n### Error handling (from DESIGN.md Section 8)\n\n| Error | Strategy | Max Retries |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| Google 429 | Exponential backoff | 5 |\n| Google 500/503 | Backoff | 3 |\n| Google 401 | Refresh token, retry | 1 |\n| Google 403 | Mark mirror ERROR, no retry | 0 |\n\nAfter max retries exhausted: set mirror state='ERROR' with error_message.\n\n### Bindings required\n- AccountDO (for getAccessToken)\n- UserGraphDO (for mirror state updates)\n\n## Testing\n\n- Integration test: UPSERT_MIRROR creates new event in target calendar\n- Integration test: UPSERT_MIRROR patches existing event\n- Integration test: DELETE_MIRROR removes event from target calendar\n- Integration test: idempotency check skips duplicate writes\n- Integration test: busy overlay calendar auto-created when missing\n- Integration test: mirror state transitions (PENDING-\u003eACTIVE, ACTIVE-\u003eDELETED, *-\u003eERROR)\n- Integration test: error handling sets mirror state=ERROR after max retries\n- Unit test: idempotency key validation\n\nMANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified.

There is no fetch() handler implementation that routes incoming requests to the appropriate methods.\n\nThe API worker currently calls DOs like:\n```typescript\nawait callDO(env.USER_GRAPH, userId, '/unlinkAccount', { account_id: accountId })\n```\n\nBut the DO classes don't have a fetch() method that handles this routing pattern.\n\n## Expected State\nEach DO should have a fetch() handler that:\n1. Parses the request path to determine which method to invoke\n2. Extracts parameters from request body\n3. Calls the appropriate method\n4. Returns JSON response\n\nExample pattern:\n```typescript\nasync fetch(request: Request): Promise\u003cResponse\u003e {\n  const url = new URL(request.url)\n  const path = url.pathname\n  \n  if (path === '/unlinkAccount') {\n    const body = await request.json()\n    const result = await this.unlinkAccount(body.account_id)\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true, data: result }))\n  }\n  // ... other routes\n}\n```\n\n## Scope\n- AccountDO: /revokeTokens, /stopWatchChannels, /getAccessToken, /initialize, etc.\n- UserGraphDO: /unlinkAccount, /applyProviderDelta, /listCanonicalEvents, etc.\n\n## Impact\n- Current code works in tests but may not work in production deployment\n- Missing production RPC routing layer\n- Need to verify whether Cloudflare DO runtime requires fetch() or supports direct method calls\n\n## Tasks\n1. Research Cloudflare DO RPC patterns (do direct method calls work in production?)\n2. If fetch() required: implement handler in each DO class\n3. Add integration tests that use fetch() pattern instead of direct calls\n4. Update callDO helper in API worker if needed\n\n## Priority\nP3 - Current architecture works for tests.

{"id":"TM-85p","title":"Implement Microsoft webhook handler and subscription lifecycle","description":"Add Microsoft Graph change notification (webhook) support to the webhook worker and subscription lifecycle management to cron worker.\n\n## What to implement\n\n### 1. Microsoft webhook handler (workers/webhook/src/index.ts)\nAdd route: POST /webhook/microsoft\n\nMicrosoft notification flow:\na. Subscription creation triggers validation handshake:\n   - Microsoft POSTs to notificationUrl with ?validationToken=\u003ctoken\u003e\n   - Must respond with validationToken as plain text, 200 OK, within 10 seconds\nb. Change notifications arrive as POST with JSON body:\n   {\n     \"value\": [{\n       \"subscriptionId\": \"...\",\n       \"changeType\": \"created|updated|deleted\",\n       \"clientState\": \"secret-for-validation\",\n       \"resource\": \"users/{id}/events/{event-id}\",\n       \"resourceData\": { \"@odata.type\": \"#microsoft.graph.event\", \"id\": \"...\" }\n     }]\n   }\nc. Validate clientState matches stored secret\nd. For each notification: enqueue SYNC_INCREMENTAL to sync-queue with account_id derived from subscriptionId lookup in D1\n\n### 2. Subscription management in AccountDO\nAdd methods to AccountDO:\n- createSubscription(webhookUrl: string): POST /subscriptions via MicrosoftCalendarClient.watchEvents()\n- renewSubscription(subscriptionId: string): PATCH /subscriptions/{id} with new expirationDateTime\n- deleteSubscription(subscriptionId: string): DELETE /subscriptions/{id}\n\nStore subscription data in AccountDO SQLite:\nCREATE TABLE ms_subscriptions (\n  subscription_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n  resource TEXT NOT NULL,\n  client_state TEXT NOT NULL,\n  expiration TEXT NOT NULL,\n  created_at TEXT NOT NULL\n);\n\n### 3. Subscription renewal in cron worker\nMicrosoft subscriptions max 3 days (4230 min) for calendar events.\nAdd to cron worker: renew Microsoft subscriptions at 75% lifetime (~2.25 days = 54 hours).\nThis is separate from Google channel renewal (6 hours).\n\nCron schedule: Add a new trigger or extend existing 6-hour trigger to check both providers.\n\n### 4. D1 subscription lookup\nFor incoming webhooks, need to map subscriptionId -\u003e account_id.\nAdd to D1 registry:\nCREATE TABLE ms_subscriptions (\n  subscription_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n  account_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))\n);\n\nOr: store in AccountDO and do a lookup via AccountDO fetch.\n\n## Files to modify\n- workers/webhook/src/index.ts (add /webhook/microsoft route)\n- durable-objects/account/src/index.ts (add subscription methods)\n- workers/cron/src/index.ts (add Microsoft subscription renewal)\n- packages/d1-registry/migrations/ (add ms_subscriptions table if using D1 lookup)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: validation handshake returns validationToken as plain text\n- Unit test: change notification parsing and clientState validation\n- Unit test: subscription creation/renewal/deletion\n- Real integration test: POST /webhook/microsoft with valid notification enqueues sync message\n- Real integration test: subscription renewal extends expiration\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. POST /webhook/microsoft?validationToken=X returns X as plain text (handshake)\n2. POST /webhook/microsoft with change notification enqueues SYNC_INCREMENTAL\n3. clientState validated against stored secret\n4. Subscription creation stores data in AccountDO\n5.

{"id":"TM-903","title":"Fix Microsoft Graph API rejecting bare \\$expand=extensions","description":"## What\n\nThe Microsoft Graph API rejects bare `$expand=extensions` with a 400 error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"ErrorGraphExtensionExpandRequiresFilter\",\n    \"message\": \"When expanding extensions, a filter must be provided to specify which extensions to expand.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis breaks 3 of 9 cross-provider E2E tests in `tests/e2e/cross-provider.real.integration.test.ts`. Microsoft calendar sync does not work against the real API.\n\n## Why\n\nMicrosoft Calendar sync is essential for T-Minus cross-provider federation. Per BUSINESS.md, the core value proposition is syncing events across Google and Microsoft calendars. If the Microsoft Graph API calls fail on the very first list/sync operation, no events can be read from Microsoft accounts.\n\nThe `$expand=extensions` query parameter is used to retrieve open extensions (specifically `com.tminus.metadata`) that mark T-Minus managed events. Without these extensions in the response, the sync-consumer cannot determine whether an event is a managed mirror (Invariant E: skip re-syncing managed mirrors to prevent sync loops).\n\n## Root Cause\n\nMicrosoft Graph API requires a filter when expanding extensions. The correct syntax is:\n\n```\n$expand=Extensions($filter=Id eq 'com.tminus.metadata')\n```\n\nNOT:\n\n```\n$expand=extensions\n```\n\nThis affects TWO files:\n\n1. **`scripts/test/microsoft-test-client.ts`** (MicrosoftTestClient.listEvents at line 323-354):\n   - Uses `$expand=extensions` in both calendarView and events queries\n   - Line 334: `\u0026$expand=extensions`\n   - Line 337: `$expand=extensions`\n\n2. **`packages/shared/src/microsoft-api.ts`** (MicrosoftCalendarClient.listEvents at line 211-253):\n   - The production client does NOT currently use `$expand=extensions` at all in listEvents\n   - However, it SHOULD expand extensions to detect managed mirrors during sync\n   - When the production client is updated to expand extensions (needed for sync to work), it must use the filtered form\n\nThe mocked tests never hit the real Microsoft Graph API, so the invalid query parameter was never caught.\n\n## How to Fix\n\n### Fix 1: MicrosoftTestClient (scripts/test/microsoft-test-client.ts)\n\nReplace all instances of `$expand=extensions` with `$expand=Extensions($filter=Id eq 'com.tminus.metadata')`:\n\n```typescript\n// BEFORE (line 334):\n`\u0026$expand=extensions`\n\n// AFTER:\n`\u0026$expand=Extensions($filter=Id eq 'com.tminus.metadata')`\n\n// BEFORE (line 337):\n`$expand=extensions`\n\n// AFTER:\n`$expand=Extensions($filter=Id eq 'com.tminus.metadata')`\n```\n\nNote: The `$expand` value needs URL encoding for the parentheses and spaces. Use `encodeURIComponent` or ensure the URL is properly constructed:\n\n```typescript\nconst expandParam = \"$expand=Extensions($filter=Id eq 'com.tminus.metadata')\";\n// When appended to URL, the graph API accepts this without additional encoding\n```\n\n### Fix 2: MicrosoftCalendarClient (packages/shared/src/microsoft-api.ts)\n\nIn the `listEvents()` method, when building the initial URL (not deltaLink/nextLink), add the filtered $expand parameter:\n\n```typescript\n// In listEvents(), when constructing the default URL (line 226):\nurl = `${MS_GRAPH_BASE}/me/calendars/${calendarId}/events?$expand=Extensions($filter=Id eq 'com.tminus.metadata')`;\n```\n\nFor delta queries, the deltaLink/nextLink URLs are complete URLs returned by the API, so they should not be modified (the API includes the $expand in the delta response URLs automatically if it was in the original request).\n\n**Important**: Verify that the calendarView endpoint also needs the filtered expand. Delta queries may handle extensions differently than calendarView.\n\n## T-Minus Open Extension Name\n\nThe extension name used throughout the codebase is `com.tminus.metadata`. This is defined as a constant in `packages/shared/src/microsoft-api.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nconst TMINUS_EXTENSION_NAME = \"com.tminus.metadata\";\n```\n\nThe filter must reference this exact name. Use the constant where possible to avoid string duplication.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `scripts/test/microsoft-test-client.ts` -- Fix `$expand=extensions` in listEvents() method (lines 334, 337)\n- `packages/shared/src/microsoft-api.ts` -- Add filtered `$expand` to listEvents() default URL construction\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `MicrosoftTestClient.listEvents()` succeeds against real Microsoft Graph API (no 400 error)\n2. `MicrosoftCalendarClient.listEvents()` succeeds against real Microsoft Graph API (no 400 error)\n3. Events returned include extension data when present (for managed mirror detection)\n4. All 3 previously-failing cross-provider E2E tests pass:\n   - \"AC1: Event created in Google Account A produces Busy block in Microsoft Account B\"\n   - \"AC2: Event created in Microsoft Account B produces Busy block in Google Account A\"\n   - \"Cleanup: test artifacts can be identified and removed\"\n5. All 9 cross-provider E2E tests pass (`make test-e2e`)\n6. All existing mocked Microsoft integration tests continue to pass\n7. The `TMINUS_EXTENSION_NAME` constant is used (not a hardcoded string) where practical\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- **Unit tests**: Test MicrosoftCalendarClient.listEvents() constructs URL with filtered $expand parameter (mock fetchFn, verify URL)\n- **Unit tests**: Test that deltaLink/nextLink URLs are used as-is (not modified)\n- **Integration tests (real)**: All 9 cross-provider E2E tests pass (`make test-e2e`)\n- **Integration tests (mocked)**: Existing Microsoft-related mocked tests continue to pass\n\n## MANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified. Standard Microsoft Graph API query parameter syntax. No specialized skill requirements.","notes":"DELIVERED:\n- CI Results: lint PASS, test PASS (399 unit tests in shared + 76 script tests), integration PASS (382/386 -- 4 pre-existing failures in write-consumer unrelated to this story), build PASS\n- Wiring: No new functions/classes created.

{"id":"TM-9iu","title":"Phase 6D: Domain-Wide Delegation for Workspace Orgs","description":"Enable Google Workspace administrators to grant T-Minus access to all users in their organization via domain-wide delegation of authority. Individual users never see an OAuth consent screen -- the admin authorizes once via Google Admin Console, and all org members' calendars become available to T-Minus.\n\nThis is the killer B2B feature for the ICP. When a fractional CXO joins a company's Workspace, their work calendar appears in T-Minus automatically -- zero setup on their end. The admin handles authorization; the user just opens T-Minus and their new company's calendar is already there.\n\nRequires Google Cloud service account with domain-wide delegation, admin consent flow via Google Admin Console, per-user impersonation via the Google Calendar API, and compliance with Google's security requirements for service accounts accessing user data.\n\nDepends on Phase 6A (onboarding flow) and Phase 6B (Marketplace presence and verified OAuth).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Workspace admin can authorize domain-wide delegation via Google Admin Console integration\n2. Service account correctly impersonates individual users to access their calendars\n3. New Workspace users automatically discovered and their calendars federable\n4. Departing users' calendars automatically disconnected on org removal\n5.

Store the service account JSON key (encrypted per AD-2) in T-Minus configuration.\n\n2. **Admin authorization guide**: A page that walks the Workspace admin through:\n   - Navigate to Google Admin Console \u003e Security \u003e API Controls \u003e Domain-wide Delegation\n   - Add the T-Minus service account client ID\n   - Grant scopes: calendar.readonly, calendar.events, calendar.calendarlist.readonly\n   - Confirm delegation\n\n3. **Org registration endpoint**: POST /api/orgs/register\n   - Admin provides their Workspace domain and confirms delegation is configured\n   - T-Minus validates delegation by attempting a test API call impersonating the admin\n   - On success, creates org record with domain and service account binding\n\n4. **User impersonation**: When an org user visits T-Minus:\n   - Detect their email domain matches a registered org\n   - Use service account to impersonate the user (JWT assertion with subject claim)\n   - Fetch their calendar list and events\n   - Display in T-Minus as a connected account (no OAuth required from the user)\n\n## Architecture context\n- Service account credentials stored in encrypted KV or DO (per AD-2)\n- Impersonation uses Google's JWT-based OAuth2 flow (no user-facing consent)\n- Org record stored in D1 registry (cross-user lookup per AD-1)\n- Per-user calendar data stored in UserGraphDO (per AD-1)\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Service account setup, admin guide, org registration, user impersonation, basic calendar access\n- OUT: Automatic user discovery (later story), admin dashboard, departing user handling, rate limiting\n\n## Testing\n- Integration test: service account impersonation fetches user calendar\n- Integration test: org registration validates delegation\n- Integration test: org user sees calendar without personal OAuth\n- Unit test: JWT assertion generation for impersonation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Service account can impersonate a Workspace user and fetch their calendars\n2. Admin authorization guide is clear and non-technical\n3. Org registration validates delegation before accepting\n4.

While configuration is correct and unit-tested, the Testing section explicitly requires integration tests proving the DLQ mechanism works end-to-end.\n\nFIX: Two options:\n\nOption 1 (RECOMMENDED): Update story scope to acknowledge dependency constraint:\n- This is a configuration-only story\n- Integration tests for DLQ behavior CANNOT be written until consumers (TM-9w7, TM-7i5) are implemented  \n- Add note to consumer stories (TM-9w7, TM-7i5): \"Must include integration test proving DLQ receives messages after max_retries and preserves original message body\"\n- Update this story's Testing section to clarify: only unit tests for config validation required\n- Resubmit for acceptance with current unit tests\n\nOption 2: Implement stub consumers for testing:\n- Create minimal sync-consumer/write-consumer stubs that can fail messages\n- Write integration tests proving messages reach DLQ after max_retries\n- Not recommended: significant work for limited value (real tests will come with consumer implementation)\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Choose Option 1.

Extended with all-optional fields for backwards compatibility.\n- Google API uses string types for status/visibility/transparency rather than union literals. The normalize function narrows these to the CanonicalEvent union types with safe defaults.\n- The ProviderDelta.event includes origin_account_id and origin_event_id since CanonicalEvent has them and they are not in the Omit list. This is intentional -- the canonical store needs these fields.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [CONCERN] packages/shared/src/types.ts: GoogleCalendarEvent uses string for status/visibility/transparency rather than literal unions. This means any invalid string from Google API is silently accepted.

{"id":"TM-aeu","title":"Fix GoogleCalendarClient.listEvents returning undefined nextSyncToken","description":"## What\n\n`GoogleCalendarClient.listEvents()` in `packages/shared/src/google-api.ts` returns `undefined` for `nextSyncToken` when called against the real Google Calendar API. The real integration test at line 401 of `workers/sync-consumer/src/sync-consumer.real.integration.test.ts` fails:\n\n```\nexpect(result.nextSyncToken).toBeTruthy()  // FAILS: result.nextSyncToken is undefined\n```\n\nThis breaks 4 of 17 sync-consumer real integration tests. Without a working syncToken, incremental sync (the core feature of T-Minus Phase 1) does not work against the real API.\n\n## Why\n\nIncremental sync is the foundation of T-Minus. Per BUSINESS.md Outcome 1, calendar changes must propagate within 5 minutes. The sync engine uses `nextSyncToken` from the initial full sync to perform subsequent incremental syncs. If the token is never returned, every sync becomes a full sync (expensive, slow, defeats the purpose).\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe Google Calendar API returns `nextSyncToken` ONLY on the LAST page of results. When there are multiple pages of events:\n1. The first page returns `nextPageToken` (but NO `nextSyncToken`)\n2. Intermediate pages return `nextPageToken`\n3. The LAST page returns `nextSyncToken` (and NO `nextPageToken`)\n\nThe current `listEvents()` implementation at `packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:182-205` does a SINGLE API call and returns whatever fields are on that response. If the calendar has enough events to trigger pagination, the first call returns `nextPageToken` but not `nextSyncToken`. The caller gets `undefined` for `nextSyncToken`.\n\nThe mocked tests hardcoded `nextSyncToken` in every response, hiding this pagination behavior.\n\n## Current Implementation (packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:182-205)\n\n```typescript\nasync listEvents(\n  calendarId: string,\n  syncToken?: string,\n  pageToken?: string,\n): Promise\u003cListEventsResponse\u003e {\n  const params = new URLSearchParams();\n  if (syncToken) {\n    params.set(\"syncToken\", syncToken);\n  }\n  if (pageToken) {\n    params.set(\"pageToken\", pageToken);\n  }\n  const url = ...;\n  const body = await this.request\u003cGoogleEventsListRaw\u003e(url, { method: \"GET\" });\n  return {\n    events: body.items ?? [],\n    nextPageToken: body.nextPageToken,\n    nextSyncToken: body.nextSyncToken,  // \u003c-- undefined on first page\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## How to Fix\n\nThere are two valid approaches. Choose the one that maintains backward compatibility with the sync-consumer's existing call pattern:\n\n**Option A: Auto-paginate within listEvents()** (RECOMMENDED)\n- If a full sync (no syncToken, no pageToken), paginate automatically until no more `nextPageToken`\n- Accumulate all events across pages\n- Return the final page's `nextSyncToken`\n- This matches how the sync-consumer expects to use listEvents: one call = all events + syncToken\n- Important: for incremental syncs (syncToken provided), also paginate to completion\n\n```typescript\nasync listEvents(\n  calendarId: string,\n  syncToken?: string,\n  pageToken?: string,\n): Promise\u003cListEventsResponse\u003e {\n  const allEvents: GoogleCalendarEvent[] = [];\n  let currentPageToken = pageToken;\n  let finalSyncToken: string | undefined;\n\n  do {\n    const params = new URLSearchParams();\n    if (syncToken) {\n      params.set(\"syncToken\", syncToken);\n    }\n    if (currentPageToken) {\n      params.set(\"pageToken\", currentPageToken);\n    }\n    const url = ...;\n    const body = await this.request\u003cGoogleEventsListRaw\u003e(url, { method: \"GET\" });\n    allEvents.push(...(body.items ?? []));\n    currentPageToken = body.nextPageToken;\n    finalSyncToken = body.nextSyncToken;\n  } while (currentPageToken);\n\n  return {\n    events: allEvents,\n    nextPageToken: undefined,  // Fully paginated\n    nextSyncToken: finalSyncToken,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**Option B: Return as-is, let caller paginate**\n- Keep current single-call behavior\n- Add documentation that caller must loop on nextPageToken until nextSyncToken appears\n- This requires updating the sync-consumer to handle pagination explicitly\n\nOption A is recommended because the sync-consumer already expects \"one call = all events + token\" and the CalendarProvider interface contract implies complete results.\n\n**Important edge case**: When calling with a `syncToken` for incremental sync, the response may ALSO have pagination (if many events changed). The fix must handle pagination in both full-sync and incremental-sync modes.\n\n**Additional fix needed for initial full sync**: When doing a full sync (no syncToken), Google Calendar API requires either `timeMin` or `syncToken`. Without `timeMin`, the API uses a default time range. The current implementation does NOT set `timeMin` when doing a full sync without syncToken. Verify this works against the real API and add `timeMin` if needed (e.g., events from the last year).\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `packages/shared/src/google-api.ts` -- Add auto-pagination logic to `listEvents()`\n- `packages/shared/src/google-api.test.ts` -- Update unit tests for pagination behavior\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `client.listEvents(\"primary\")` returns a truthy `nextSyncToken` string when called against the real Google Calendar API (regardless of event count)\n2. `client.listEvents(\"primary\", syncToken)` returns a truthy `nextSyncToken` for incremental sync\n3. All events across all pages are returned in a single response\n4. The existing CalendarProvider interface contract is maintained (no signature changes)\n5. All 4 previously-failing sync-consumer real integration tests pass:\n   - \"GoogleCalendarClient.listEvents works with real access token\"\n   - \"full sync flow: list all events, classify, normalize to deltas\"\n   - \"incremental sync flow: use syncToken to get only changes\"\n   - \"deleted events appear as cancelled in incremental sync\"\n6. All existing mocked sync-consumer integration tests continue to pass\n7. All existing shared package unit tests continue to pass\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- **Unit tests**: Test pagination behavior with mock fetchFn returning multi-page responses:\n  - Page 1: items + nextPageToken, no nextSyncToken\n  - Page 2: items + nextSyncToken, no nextPageToken\n  - Verify all items collected, final syncToken returned\n- **Unit tests**: Test single-page response (current behavior, regression test)\n- **Unit tests**: Test incremental sync pagination (syncToken + multi-page)\n- **Integration tests (real)**: All 17 sync-consumer real integration tests must pass\n- **Integration tests (mocked)**: Existing sync-consumer.integration.test.ts must pass\n\n## MANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified. Standard Google Calendar API pagination pattern. No specialized skill requirements.","notes":"DELIVERED:\n- CI Results: lint PASS, test PASS (541 unit tests), integration PASS (381 tests), build PASS\n- Wiring: listEvents() is an existing method already called by sync-consumer, onboarding workflow, and reconcile workflow -- no new wiring needed\n- Commit: 302fe66526f4ddd553b585172fca31e7e02a03b4 pushed to origin/beads-sync\n- Test Output:\n  Unit:        14 test files, 396 tests (shared) + 145 tests (other packages) = 541 total PASS\n  Integration: 13 test files, 381 tests PASS\n  Build:       12 packages all PASS\n  Lint:        12 packages all PASS\n\nAC Verification:\n| AC # | Requirement | Code Location | Test Location | Status |\n|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| 1 | listEvents must paginate through ALL pages following nextPageToken | packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:199-220 (do...while loop) | google-api.test.ts:137-193 (auto-paginates through 3 pages) | PASS |\n| 2 | Return nextSyncToken from the last page of results | packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:217-219 (captures on final page) | google-api.test.ts:180 (expects \"sync_final\" from page 3) | PASS |\n| 3 | syncToken properly included on paginated incremental sync requests | packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:202-204 (syncToken set on every page) | google-api.test.ts:257-296 (verifies syncToken+pageToken on page 2) | PASS |\n| 4 | Single-page responses return immediately (no perf regression) | packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:220 (while exits when no nextPageToken) | google-api.test.ts:212-224 (only 1 fetch call for single page) | PASS |\n| 5 | Existing callers (onboarding, reconcile, sync-consumer) still work | All 381 integration tests pass | onboarding.integration.test.ts, reconcile.integration.test.ts, sync-consumer.integration.test.ts | PASS |\n\nLEARNINGS:\n- Google Calendar API returns nextSyncToken ONLY on the final page of paginated results.

The fix is a thin dev-entry.ts that only re-exports default + DO classes. Production wrangler deploy may have the same issue -- needs investigation.\n- The ulid package uses Node.js crypto.randomBytes internally, which doesn't exist in the Workers runtime. Must use --compatibility-flags=nodejs_compat when running wrangler dev locally.\n- wrangler dev creates a fresh local D1 database on each restart if state is cleared. D1 migrations must be applied separately via wrangler d1 execute since the worker's wrangler.toml doesn't have migrations_dir set.\n- Register endpoint rate limit is 5/hr/IP. E2E tests must be structured to register all needed users upfront (in beforeAll) before rate limit testing consumes the quota.\n- JWT iat timestamp uses second precision. Two JWTs generated within the same second for the same user will be identical. Tests comparing old vs new JWT must include a \u003e1s delay between issuances.\n- The UserGraphDO.handleFetch() method is named \"handleFetch\" not \"fetch\", which causes \"Handler does not export a fetch() function\" in workerd. This means /v1/events returns 500 in local wrangler dev. E2E tests use /v1/api-keys (D1-only) as the authenticated endpoint instead.\n- vitest.workspace.ts is auto-detected and merged into any config. To isolate E2E tests from workspace projects, use test.projects in the config (overrides workspace).\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [ISSUE] durable-objects/user-graph/src/index.ts: UserGraphDO uses handleFetch() instead of fetch(). workerd requires the method to be named \"fetch\". This blocks wrangler dev for any endpoint that calls a DO. Production deployment will also fail.\n- [ISSUE] workers/api/src/index.ts: Named exports (API_VERSION, ErrorCode, successEnvelope, etc.) prevent workerd from starting the worker. Production deployment via wrangler deploy may have the same issue. The dev-entry.ts workaround only solves the local dev case.\n- [CONCERN] D1 migrations are not in the api worker's wrangler.toml (migrations_dir). Local dev requires manual migration application. The wrangler-d1.toml has it but is a separate config.\n- [CONCERN] ulid package requires Node.js crypto.randomBytes. Without nodejs_compat flag, the worker crashes on any operation that generates IDs. This needs to be in the production wrangler.toml compatibility_flags.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ramxx@ramirosalas.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:52:41.399048-08:00","created_by":"RamXX","updated_at":"2026-02-14T20:39:43.271761-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T20:39:43.271761-08:00","close_reason":"Verified: 26 E2E tests pass against live wrangler dev, all 11 Phase 2A scenarios validated","labels":["delivered","e2e-validation"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"TM-as6.10","depends_on_id":"TM-as6","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:52:41.399747-08:00","created_by":"RamXX"},{"issue_id":"TM-as6.10","depends_on_id":"TM-as6.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:59:22.0442-08:00","created_by":"RamXX"},{"issue_id":"TM-as6.10","depends_on_id":"TM-as6.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:59:22.113734-08:00","created_by":"RamXX"},{"issue_id":"TM-as6.10","depends_on_id":"TM-as6.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:59:22.185266-08:00","created_by":"RamXX"},{"issue_id":"TM-as6.10","depends_on_id":"TM-as6.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:59:22.254615-08:00","created_by":"RamXX"},{"issue_id":"TM-as6.10","depends_on_id":"TM-as6.8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:59:22.323889-08:00","created_by":"RamXX"},{"issue_id":"TM-as6.10","depends_on_id":"TM-as6.9","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:59:22.395556-08:00","created_by":"RamXX"}]}

Placing them under /v1/api-keys keeps them under the authenticated router, which is architecturally correct. If PM requires /v1/auth/api-keys, the route paths can be trivially changed.\n\nLEARNINGS:\n- The main API worker (index.ts) uses a custom router pattern (matchRoute), not Hono routing. The auth middleware (middleware/auth.ts) uses Hono. Both needed API key support since they serve different parts of the application.\n- SHA-256 via Web Crypto (crypto.subtle.digest) works identically in Node.js (vitest) and Cloudflare Workers runtime -- no polyfill needed.\n- Prefix-based lookup (8 hex chars) enables fast DB index scan without exposing the full key hash in queries.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [CONCERN] The staged changes included uncommitted work from TM-cep follow-up (auth routes, env.d.ts, wrangler.toml bindings).

{"id":"TM-bac","title":"Phase 3B Retrospective: VIP \u0026 Governance","notes":"# Phase 3B Retrospective: VIP \u0026 Governance\n\n## Stories Completed: 8/8\n- TM-5rp.1: VIP Override\n- TM-yke.2: Working Hours Enforcement\n- TM-yke.3: Billable Time Tagging\n- TM-yke.4: Commitment Tracking\n- TM-yke.5: Commitment Proof Export\n- TM-yke.6: VIP \u0026 Governance MCP Tools\n- TM-yke.7: Governance Dashboard UI\n- TM-yke.8: Phase 3B E2E Validation\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n### 1. ULID Test ID Pattern (RECURRING - HIGH PRIORITY)\nMultiple stories (TM-yke.4, TM-yke.5, TM-yke.8) struggled with Crockford Base32 validation in test fixture IDs. The pattern `01HXY000000000000000000E01` (exactly 26 chars, valid chars only) works reliably. Characters I, L, O, U are NOT valid in Crockford Base32.\n**ACTION**: Document standard test ID patterns in CLAUDE.md or a shared test helper.\n\n### 2. Cross-Story Proactive Implementation Works Well\nTM-yke.4 proactively added MCP tool handlers alongside the API/DO commitment tracking, which reduced TM-yke.6 to primarily test-writing. This pattern of \"implement the full vertical slice\" is efficient when stories are closely related.\n**ACTION**: When designing stories, consider vertical slices over horizontal layers.\n\n### 3. Workers Runtime Constraints\nTrue PDF generation is impractical without large libraries in Workers. Structured text documents with SHA-256 hash provide equivalent verifiability.\nR2 bucket bindings must be declared in wrangler.toml for EACH environment separately.\n**ACTION**: Document Workers runtime constraints in project knowledge base.\n\n### 4. File Size Concern\nworkers/mcp/src/index.ts is now 3,289 lines. Should split into modules (governance-tools.ts, scheduling-tools.ts).\n**ACTION**: Create tech debt story for MCP worker refactoring.\n\n### 5. DO Response Wrapping Convention\ncallDO already wraps responses, so DO pathResponses must return RAW data. Some handlers use `result.data.items ?? result.data` fallback pattern inconsistently.\n**ACTION**: Standardize DO response convention across all handlers.\n\n### 6. UI Testing Patterns\n- React Testing Library's within() scoped to data-testid containers is the robust approach when text appears in multiple sections\n- Inline SVG-less horizontal bars (div with percentage width) avoid chart library dependencies\n- React act() warnings in loading-state tests are pre-existing across Billing, Governance, Scheduling pages\n\n### 7. Stale Test Assertions\nMCP tool count assertion keeps drifting as new tools are added across stories.\n**ACTION**: Remove or make the assertion count dynamic (e.g., \u003e= N).\n\n## Observations (Pre-existing Issues)\n- workers/api/src/index.ts: TODO for rate limit tier extraction from JWT\n- React act() warnings in multiple page test files\n- VIP override integration test in scheduling may have intermittent failures\n\n## Metrics\n- All 8 stories first-time accepted (no rejections)\n- Full monorepo: 1,961+ unit tests passing\n- Integration: 1,042+ tests passing\n- Build: All 17 workspace projects compile clean","status":"closed","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ramxx@ramirosalas.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T03:03:43.077385-08:00","created_by":"RamXX","updated_at":"2026-02-15T03:04:03.895849-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T03:04:03.895849-08:00","close_reason":"Phase 3B retro complete"}

However, the 14 integration tests that call handleIncrementalSync/handleFullSync/createQueueHandler did NOT pass sleepFn: noopSleep. While these tests used mocks that succeed on first call (no retries triggered), this was fragile: any future test modification adding error scenarios would silently introduce real delays and timeouts.\n\nThe fix adds sleepFn: noopSleep to all 13 handler-level call sites (10 handleIncrementalSync, 2 handleFullSync, 1 createQueueHandler) for defensive consistency. The DLQ test already had it.\n\nLEARNINGS:\n- The injectable dependency pattern (FetchFn, sleepFn) works well for testability.

Delivered complete REST API surface for T-Minus Phase 1 with JWT auth, consistent response envelope, account/event/policy/sync endpoints, and comprehensive test coverage (62 tests: 35 unit + 27 integration). Full monorepo suite validates integration (513 tests, 0 failures).\n\nWHAT WENT WELL\n1. **Strict AC adherence** - All 10 acceptance criteria verified with specific code locations and test coverage. AC verification table in delivery notes provides clear traceability.\n\n2. **Test-first development paid off** - 62 tests (35 unit + 27 integration) caught ID format issues, envelope structure inconsistencies, and auth edge cases before deployment. Integration tests with real D1 (via better-sqlite3) validated DO communication patterns.\n\n3. **Reusable patterns emerged** - createRealD1() helper from webhook/cron tests proved reliable and was successfully reused. Web Crypto API for JWT HS256 eliminated external dependencies while maintaining security.\n\n4. **Envelope consistency achieved** - All endpoints use {ok, data, error, meta} structure with request_id and timestamp. Error taxonomy (AUTH_REQUIRED, FORBIDDEN, NOT_FOUND, etc.) applied uniformly across all handlers.\n\n5. **DO communication pattern clarified** - stub.fetch() with JSON body containing action field + DO internal routing is clean and testable. Tests validated delegation to AccountDO and UserGraphDO.\n\nWHAT COULD BE IMPROVED\n1. **ID validation strictness discovered late** - ULID format (26 Crockford Base32 chars after 4-char prefix = 30 total) caught multiple test fixture errors. Should establish ID generation helpers early in future epics.\n\n2. **Security concerns flagged but deferred** - JWT_SECRET has no rotation mechanism, no rate limiting on API endpoints. These are tracked as OBSERVATIONS but should be elevated to Phase 2 stories proactively.\n\n3. **Integration test setup boilerplate** - Each integration test suite recreates similar setup (D1 schema, DO bindings, miniflare env). Could extract to shared test utilities.\n\nPATTERNS TO REPLICATE\n1. **AC verification tables in delivery notes** - Clear mapping of AC # -\u003e Code Location -\u003e Test Location -\u003e Status builds confidence and speeds acceptance reviews.\n\n2. **Real database in integration tests** - createRealD1() pattern with better-sqlite3 catches SQL errors, constraint violations, and schema issues that mocks would hide.\n\n3. **Web Crypto API for Workers crypto needs** - No external JWT library needed. Keeps bundle small, reduces supply chain risk.\n\n4. **Envelope-first API design** - Consistent {ok, data, error, meta} structure simplifies client SDK generation and error handling in future phases.\n\n5. **Route param extraction via path splitting** - Simple, testable, no regex complexity.\n\nRISKS \u0026 TECHNICAL DEBT TO TRACK\n1. **[SECURITY] JWT_SECRET rotation** - Single static secret with no rotation mechanism. Need key versioning before production. (Recommend creating story in Phase 2 epic)\n\n2. **[SECURITY] No rate limiting** - API endpoints lack per-user rate limiting. Easy DOS vector. AccountDO could enforce per-account quotas. (Recommend creating story in Phase 2 epic)\n\n3. **[TESTING] Integration test setup duplication** - createRealD1(), DO binding mocks, miniflare setup repeated across test files. Extract to shared/testing-utils.ts. (Nice-to-have refactor)\n\n4. **[OBSERVABILITY] No request tracing** - request_id in envelope but no distributed tracing integration. Phase 2 should add tracing headers for multi-worker request flows.\n\nACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FOR FUTURE WORK\n1. **For all API stories**: Establish ID generation helpers (ulid(), prefixedId()) in shared package first. Prevents test fixture errors.\n\n2. **For all authentication flows**: Security concerns (key rotation, rate limiting) should be explicit ACs or tracked as dedicated stories, not deferred to OBSERVATIONS.\n\n3. **For all integration test suites**: Extract common setup (createRealD1, miniflare config, DO binding stubs) to shared/testing-utils.ts before writing first test.\n\n4. **For all REST endpoints**: AC verification table format (AC # | Requirement | Code Location | Test Location | Status) should be standard delivery evidence.\n\n5. **For Phase 2 planning**: Elevate JWT_SECRET rotation and rate limiting from OBSERVATIONS to explicit stories in Phase 2 backlog.\n\nMETRICS\n- Stories in epic: 1\n- Stories accepted first try: 1 (100%)\n- Stories rejected: 0\n- Test coverage: 62 tests (35 unit + 27 integration)\n- Monorepo validation: 513 tests, 19 files, 0 failures\n- Critical insights: 2 (security: JWT rotation, rate limiting)\n- Important insights: 3 (ID helpers, integration test utils, AC verification tables)\n\nFILES DELIVERED\n- workers/api/index.ts (main handler with auth, routing, envelope, all endpoint handlers)\n- workers/api/index.test.ts (35 unit tests)\n- workers/api/index.integration.test.ts (27 integration tests)\n- Commit: be0aad029c97741a1f641617e2e802cacb6fa9cc on main\n\nNEXT STEPS\nEpic TM-cd1 is complete and verified.

Users can import calendars via ICS feed URLs (zero authentication required, read-only) to see a unified calendar view immediately. Once they experience the value of multi-calendar federation, contextual prompts guide them to upgrade to full OAuth sync for real-time updates and write access.\n\nThis aligns with AD-4 (busy overlay by default) -- the ICS-imported view IS the busy overlay. The upgrade to full OAuth adds bidirectional sync, real-time updates, and write-back capability.\n\nThe ICP (fractional CXOs, consultants) manages 3-6 calendars and is skeptical of granting permissions to yet another app. ICS-first onboarding lets them see the value proposition -- \"all my calendars in one place\" -- before trusting T-Minus with write access. Every major calendar provider (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Fastmail, ProtonMail) supports ICS feed export.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1.

The walking skeleton uses basic parsing; this story handles the long tail of edge cases that real calendar providers produce. Google, Microsoft, Apple, Fastmail, and ProtonMail all emit subtly different ICS output. The parser must handle them all.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **Full iCalendar component support**:\n   - VEVENT: standard events (single, all-day, multi-day)\n   - VEVENT with RRULE: recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, with EXDATE exceptions)\n   - VEVENT with VALARM: event reminders/alarms\n   - VTODO: tasks/to-dos (map to CanonicalEvent with task flag)\n   - VFREEBUSY: free/busy blocks (map to busy overlay per AD-4)\n   - VTIMEZONE: timezone definitions (critical for cross-timezone ICP)\n\n2. **Property handling**:\n   - DTSTART/DTEND: with TZID, UTC (Z suffix), floating time\n   - DURATION: alternative to DTEND\n   - RRULE: full RFC 5545 recurrence rule expansion (FREQ, INTERVAL, BYDAY, BYMONTH, UNTIL, COUNT)\n   - EXDATE: recurrence exceptions\n   - ATTENDEE: attendee list with PARTSTAT, ROLE, CN\n   - ORGANIZER: event organizer\n   - LOCATION: physical and virtual (Zoom/Meet URLs in LOCATION or X-properties)\n   - DESCRIPTION/SUMMARY: event details\n   - STATUS: confirmed, tentative, cancelled\n\n3. **Real-world quirks**:\n   - Line folding (RFC 5545 Section 3.1): lines longer than 75 octets folded with CRLF + space\n   - Quoted-printable and base64 encoding in property values\n   - Non-standard X-properties (X-GOOGLE-CONFERENCE, X-MICROSOFT-ONLINEMEETINGURL)\n   - Missing VTIMEZONE definitions (fall back to TZID string parsing)\n   - Apple's use of X-APPLE-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-BEHAVIOR and X-APPLE-STRUCTURED-LOCATION\n\n4. **CanonicalEvent mapping**: Each parsed component maps to the existing CanonicalEvent schema. Document the mapping table explicitly.\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Full RFC 5545 parsing, recurrence expansion, timezone handling, CanonicalEvent mapping\n- OUT: ICS generation/export (write path), iCalendar VJOURNAL component, CalDAV-specific extensions\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: 20+ real-world ICS samples from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Fastmail, ProtonMail\n- Unit test: RRULE expansion for each recurrence frequency type\n- Unit test: timezone conversion across all major timezones\n- Unit test: line folding and character encoding edge cases\n- Unit test: graceful handling of malformed ICS (partial parse, not crash)\n- Integration test: end-to-end parse of 500-event feed in under 3 seconds\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Parses VEVENT, VTODO, VFREEBUSY, VTIMEZONE components correctly\n2. Expands RRULE recurrence rules with EXDATE exceptions\n3. Handles TZID, UTC, and floating time formats for DTSTART/DTEND\n4. Extracts attendees, organizer, location (physical and virtual meeting URLs)\n5. Handles line folding, quoted-printable encoding, and non-standard X-properties\n6.

Initial implementation counted post-EXDATE instances, which is wrong. Fixed with two-phase approach: first generate all COUNT instances, then filter EXDATE.\n- WEEKLY+BYDAY recurrence is significantly more complex than DAILY/MONTHLY because you need to map day-of-week offsets within each interval week. The implementation handles this by computing week offsets and day-within-week indices.\n- Provider diversity: Microsoft uses non-IANA timezone IDs (Eastern Standard Time instead of America/New_York), Apple embeds geo URIs in LOCATION, and ProtonMail embeds Zoom URLs in LOCATION text. The parser preserves all these variants without trying to normalize timezone IDs (that would be a separate mapping concern).\n- Performance is excellent: 500 events with attendees parse in ~8ms, well under the 1-second requirement.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [ISSUE] packages/shared/src/caldav-client.ts:365 - Pre-existing TS error: CalDavClient.deleteEvent return type (Promise\u003cCalDavWriteResult\u003e) is incompatible with CalendarProvider interface (Promise\u003cvoid\u003e)\n- [ISSUE] packages/shared/src/ics-feed.ts:85 - Pre-existing TS error: URL.protocol type issue in Workers environment","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ramxx@ramirosalas.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T10:37:29.241648-08:00","created_by":"RamXX","updated_at":"2026-02-15T14:04:18.506858-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T14:04:18.506858-08:00","close_reason":"Accepted: Full RFC 5545 parser with 59 tests covering all 9 ACs.

This story builds the polling mechanism, detects changes between fetches, and marks stale feeds that fail to refresh.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **Refresh scheduler**: A cron-triggered job (via existing cron worker) that:\n   - Queries all active ICS feed accounts\n   - Fetches each feed URL\n   - Compares fetched content against last-known state\n   - Applies deltas (new/modified/deleted events) to UserGraphDO\n\n2. **Change detection**:\n   - ETag/Last-Modified: use HTTP conditional requests to avoid re-parsing unchanged feeds\n   - Content hash: if ETag not supported, hash the response body and compare\n   - Per-event comparison: for changed feeds, diff event UIDs and SEQUENCE/LAST-MODIFIED to identify changes\n\n3. **Refresh configuration**:\n   - Default interval: 15 minutes\n   - User-configurable: 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, manual only\n   - Feed-specific override: high-priority feeds can refresh more frequently\n\n4. **Staleness detection**:\n   - Track last successful refresh timestamp per feed\n   - Feed is \"stale\" if last refresh \u003e 2x the configured interval\n   - Feed is \"dead\" if last refresh \u003e 24 hours (likely broken URL)\n   - Surface staleness in provider health dashboard (Phase 6A story 5)\n\n5. **Error handling for feed refresh**:\n   - HTTP 404/410: mark feed as dead, notify user\n   - HTTP 401/403: mark feed as requiring authentication, prompt user\n   - Timeout: retry with exponential backoff, mark stale after 3 failures\n   - Malformed response: log error, keep last known good state\n\n## Business rules enforced\n- BR-1: Feed refresh is pull-only (no webhook/push mechanism for ICS)\n- BR-2: Conditional HTTP requests minimize bandwidth (ETag/Last-Modified)\n- BR-3: Stale feeds surface in health dashboard, dead feeds prompt user action\n- BR-4: Feed refresh respects rate limits (max 1 request per feed per 5 minutes)\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Periodic refresh, change detection, staleness, error handling, configurable intervals\n- OUT: Push notification alternative (WebSub/PuSH -- future), feed authentication (basic auth -- future story)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: change detection via ETag, content hash, and per-event diff\n- Unit test: staleness calculation (stale at 2x interval, dead at 24h)\n- Unit test: error classification (404, 401, timeout, malformed)\n- Integration test: cron triggers refresh for all active feeds\n- Integration test: changed feed produces correct deltas in UserGraphDO\n- Integration test: unchanged feed (ETag match) skips re-parsing\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Feeds refresh automatically at configured interval (default: 15 minutes)\n2. HTTP conditional requests (ETag/Last-Modified) avoid unnecessary re-parsing\n3. Changed events correctly detected and applied as deltas\n4. Stale feeds (\u003e2x interval) flagged in health dashboard\n5. Dead feeds (\u003e24 hours) trigger user notification\n6.

The prompts appear when the user has demonstrated enough engagement to appreciate the value of real-time sync and write access. This is not a paywall -- it is an experience upgrade. The user can dismiss prompts and stay on ICS-only indefinitely.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **Engagement tracking** (stored in UserGraphDO):\n   - Days active (unique days with calendar view access)\n   - Events viewed (count of event detail views)\n   - Conflicts detected (count of overlapping events across feeds)\n   - Feeds added (number of ICS feeds imported)\n\n2. **Prompt triggers** (configurable thresholds):\n   - \"Conflict detected\" trigger: When two events overlap across different feeds, show: \"T-Minus detected a scheduling conflict. Upgrade to full sync to automatically manage conflicts.\"\n   - \"Stale data\" trigger: When a feed is \u003e30 minutes stale, show: \"Your [provider] calendar may be out of date. Connect directly for real-time updates.\"\n   - \"Write intent\" trigger: When user attempts to create/edit an event on an ICS-only feed, show: \"ICS feeds are read-only. Connect your [provider] account to create and edit events.\"\n   - \"Engagement\" trigger: After 3+ active days, show: \"You're getting value from T-Minus! Upgrade to full sync for real-time updates and two-way editing.\"\n\n3. **Prompt UI**:\n   - Non-blocking banner at top of calendar view (not a modal)\n   - Dismissable with \"Not now\" (won't show same prompt type for 7 days)\n   - \"Upgrade\" button leads to Phase 6A onboarding flow for the relevant provider\n   - Provider-specific: Google prompt shows Google branding, etc.\n\n4. **Prompt suppression**:\n   - User can permanently dismiss all upgrade prompts via settings\n   - Already-connected providers don't trigger prompts\n   - Max 1 prompt per session (don't nag)\n\n## Business rules enforced\n- BR-1: Prompts are informational, not blocking.

{"id":"TM-dcn","title":"Create deployment automation script and Makefile targets","description":"Build deployment automation for all T-Minus Cloudflare resources, modeled on the need2watch promote.mjs pattern.\n\n## What to implement\n\n### 1. Makefile targets\n- make deploy: Deploy all workers + run D1 migrations\n- make deploy-staging: Deploy to staging environment (--env staging)\n- make deploy-secrets: Push all secrets to Cloudflare via wrangler secret put\n- make deploy-d1-migrate: Run D1 migrations on remote database\n\n### 2. Deployment script (scripts/deploy.mjs or similar)\nOrchestrate deployment of all 6 workers in correct order:\n1. Create D1 database if not exists (tminus-registry)\n2. Run D1 migrations (packages/d1-registry/migrations/)\n3. Create queues if not exist: tminus-sync-queue, tminus-write-queue, tminus-reconcile-queue, tminus-sync-queue-dlq, tminus-write-queue-dlq\n4. Deploy workers in order:\n   a. tminus-api (hosts UserGraphDO, AccountDO) -- must be first since others reference it\n   b. tminus-oauth (hosts OnboardingWorkflow)\n   c. tminus-webhook\n   d. tminus-sync-consumer\n   e. tminus-write-consumer\n   f. tminus-cron (hosts ReconcileWorkflow)\n5. Verify deployment via health check (if available)\n\n### 3. Secret management\nScript to provision secrets across all workers that need them:\n- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID -\u003e tminus-oauth\n- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET -\u003e tminus-oauth\n- MASTER_KEY -\u003e tminus-api, tminus-oauth (for token encryption)\n- JWT_SECRET -\u003e tminus-api (for API auth)\n\nPattern: Read from .env file, pipe to wrangler secret put via stdin (see need2watch promote.mjs runWithStdin pattern).\n\n### 4. Fix wrangler.toml placeholder IDs\nAll wrangler.toml files currently have placeholder-d1-id for D1 database_id. The deploy script must:\n- Create D1 database and capture the real ID\n- Update wrangler.toml files with real database_id (or use wrangler.toml [env.staging] overrides)\n\n## Environment variables required\n- CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (wrangler auth)\n- CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (7ab86a26e70036ba65256fb9aa806417)\n\n## Files to create/modify\n- scripts/deploy.mjs (new)\n- Makefile (add deploy targets)\n- .env.example (new, document required env vars)\n- workers/*/wrangler.toml (update placeholder IDs)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test for deploy script argument parsing\n- Smoke test: wrangler whoami succeeds with provided token\n- Integration test: make deploy-staging deploys all workers and returns healthy status\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. make deploy deploys all 6 workers to Cloudflare\n2. D1 database created and migrations applied\n3. All 5 queues created (3 main + 2 DLQ)\n4. Secrets provisioned from .env via wrangler secret put\n5.

This blocks ALL worker deployments.\n- [ISSUE] vitest.workspace.ts: Broken due to duplicate project name \"tminus\" across durable-objects/account and durable-objects/user-graph vitest configs. Running `npx vitest run` from root fails. Each sub-project works individually.\n- [CONCERN] packages/shared/src/wrangler-config.unit.test.ts: Has uncommitted changes fixing durable_objects.classes -\u003e durable_objects.bindings.

{"id":"TM-dxe","title":"Fix write-consumer DELETE_MIRROR 404 not handled against real Google API","description":"## What\n\nThe write-consumer's `handleDelete()` in `workers/write-consumer/src/write-consumer.ts` fails when attempting to delete a mirror event that has already been deleted from Google Calendar. The real integration test \"WriteConsumer handles DELETE_MIRROR of already-deleted event gracefully\" at line 777 of `workers/write-consumer/src/write-consumer.real.integration.test.ts` fails:\n\n```\nexpect(result.success).toBe(true)  // FAILS: result.success is false\n```\n\n## Why\n\nIdempotent deletes are essential for reliable queue processing. When the write-queue consumer processes a DELETE_MIRROR message, the target event may have already been deleted (by the user, by a previous queue retry, or by another process). The write-consumer MUST treat 404-on-delete as success because the desired end state (event gone) is already achieved. Failing on 404 causes the message to retry, eventually hitting the DLQ, and leaving the mirror state stuck instead of transitioning to DELETED.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `handleDelete()` method at line 341-399 has a try/catch that checks for `ResourceNotFoundError` and `MicrosoftResourceNotFoundError`:\n\n```typescript\ntry {\n  await client.deleteEvent(calendarId, msg.provider_event_id);\n} catch (err) {\n  if (\n    err instanceof ResourceNotFoundError ||\n    err instanceof MicrosoftResourceNotFoundError\n  ) {\n    // Event already deleted, proceed\n  } else {\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis logic LOOKS correct. However, the real Google Calendar API response for deleting an already-deleted event may not produce a `ResourceNotFoundError`. Possible issues:\n\n1. **Google may return 410 Gone instead of 404** for recently-deleted events. The catch block does not handle `SyncTokenExpiredError` (which maps 410), and there is no `410 -\u003e already deleted` mapping.\n\n2. **The error thrown may be a generic `GoogleApiError` with statusCode 404** rather than the specific `ResourceNotFoundError` subclass, if the error classification in `GoogleCalendarClient.request()` at line 341-373 does not correctly match.\n\n3. **Google may return the event with status \"cancelled\"** (200 OK response) rather than a 404, meaning deleteEvent returns normally but a subsequent check fails.\n\nThe developer MUST investigate the actual error thrown by the real API and fix accordingly. Steps:\n\n1. Add temporary logging to see what error is actually thrown when deleting an already-deleted event via the real API\n2. Check if Google returns 404 or 410 for recently-deleted events\n3. Check if `ResourceNotFoundError` instanceof check passes for the actual error object\n4. Check if the error might be caught by the outer `catch (err)` at line 392 before the inner catch at line 370\n\n## How to Fix\n\nAfter investigating the actual error shape:\n\n**If Google returns 410 Gone for recently-deleted events:**\n- Add `SyncTokenExpiredError` to the catch block (or better, check `err instanceof GoogleApiError \u0026\u0026 err.statusCode === 410`)\n- OR: Add a new `GoneError` class that maps 410 specifically for delete operations\n\n**If the instanceof check fails (e.g., different module instances):**\n- Check for `statusCode === 404` directly instead of relying on instanceof:\n```typescript\ncatch (err) {\n  const isNotFound =\n    err instanceof ResourceNotFoundError ||\n    err instanceof MicrosoftResourceNotFoundError ||\n    (err instanceof GoogleApiError \u0026\u0026 err.statusCode === 404) ||\n    (err instanceof MicrosoftApiError \u0026\u0026 err.statusCode === 404);\n  if (!isNotFound) {\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**If the issue is with the real API error response shape:**\n- Verify `GoogleCalendarClient.request()` error mapping at `packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:341-373` correctly catches 404 responses and throws `ResourceNotFoundError`\n\n## Current Error Classification (packages/shared/src/google-api.ts:341-373)\n\n```typescript\nprivate async request\u003cT\u003e(url: string, init: RequestInit): Promise\u003cT\u003e {\n  // ...\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const errorText = await response.text().catch(() =\u003e \"Unknown error\");\n    switch (response.status) {\n      case 401: throw new TokenExpiredError(errorText);\n      case 404: throw new ResourceNotFoundError(errorText);  // Should work\n      case 410: throw new SyncTokenExpiredError(errorText);\n      case 429: throw new RateLimitError(errorText);\n      default: throw new GoogleApiError(errorText, response.status);\n    }\n  }\n  // 204 No Content handling...\n}\n```\n\nThe request() method looks like it should throw `ResourceNotFoundError` for 404. If it does, the catch block in handleDelete() should work. The bug may be more subtle:\n\n- Google Calendar API may return 204 (No Content) for DELETE of already-deleted events (treated as successful no-op), not 404\n- Or Google may return 200 with the event marked \"cancelled\"\n- Or the error may be thrown but the outer catch at line 392 handles it instead of the inner catch at line 370\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `workers/write-consumer/src/write-consumer.ts` -- Fix DELETE_MIRROR 404/410 handling\n- Potentially `packages/shared/src/google-api.ts` -- Only if error classification is wrong\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `WriteConsumer.processMessage({ type: \"DELETE_MIRROR\", ... })` returns `{ success: true, action: \"deleted\" }` when the target event has already been deleted from Google Calendar\n2. Mirror state transitions to \"DELETED\" (not \"ERROR\")\n3. The real integration test \"WriteConsumer handles DELETE_MIRROR of already-deleted event gracefully\" passes\n4. All 10 write-consumer real integration tests pass\n5. All existing mocked write-consumer integration tests continue to pass\n6. Error handling covers both Google (ResourceNotFoundError, 404, 410) and Microsoft (MicrosoftResourceNotFoundError, 404) delete-of-deleted scenarios\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- **Unit tests**: Test handleDelete with both ResourceNotFoundError and GoogleApiError(404) thrown by mock client\n- **Unit tests**: Test handleDelete with 410 Gone thrown by mock client (if applicable)\n- **Integration tests (real)**: All 10 write-consumer real integration tests pass, specifically:\n  - \"WriteConsumer handles DELETE_MIRROR of already-deleted event gracefully\" must pass\n- **Integration tests (mocked)**: Existing write-consumer integration tests must pass\n\n## MANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified.

No specialized skill requirements.","notes":"DELIVERED:\n- CI Results: lint PASS, test PASS (544 unit tests), integration PASS (386 tests across 13 files), build PASS\n- Wiring: handleDelete() catch block expanded in-place; no new functions/exports added.

This SyncTokenExpiredError was NOT caught by the inner block, so it propagated to the\nouter catch which called classifyError() -\u003e handleError() -\u003e marked mirror as ERROR (permanent, no retry).\n\nFix: Expanded the catch block to check for 5 \"event already gone\" conditions:\n1. ResourceNotFoundError (Google 404)\n2. SyncTokenExpiredError (Google 410 Gone)\n3. MicrosoftResourceNotFoundError (Microsoft 404)\n4. GoogleApiError with statusCode 404 or 410 (defense in depth)\n5. MicrosoftApiError with statusCode 404 (defense in depth)\n\nNon-404/410 errors (e.g., 403 Forbidden) correctly propagate to the outer catch and mark ERROR.\n\nNew Tests Added (6):\n1. \"handles 410 Gone gracefully on delete\" -- SyncTokenExpiredError\n2. \"handles generic GoogleApiError with 404 on delete\" -- defense in depth\n3. \"handles generic GoogleApiError with 410 on delete\" -- defense in depth\n4. \"handles generic MicrosoftApiError with 404 on delete\" -- defense in depth\n5. \"still throws non-404/410 errors on delete\" -- negative test (403 = ERROR)\n6. (existing) \"handles 404 gracefully on delete\" -- ResourceNotFoundError (unchanged, still passes)\n\nLEARNINGS:\n- Google Calendar API returns 410 Gone (not 404) for events deleted within the last ~30 days.\n  The SyncTokenExpiredError class name is misleading in this context -- it's reused for all 410\n  responses, not just sync token expiry. Future refactor could add a dedicated GoneError subclass.\n- Defense in depth: isinstance checks can fail across module boundaries (different bundled copies).\n  The statusCode fallback checks (GoogleApiError with 404/410) protect against this edge case.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [CONCERN] google-api.ts:87-91: SyncTokenExpiredError is overloaded -- used for both \"sync token\n  expired\" (events.list) and \"resource gone\" (delete). Consider a GoneError subclass that maps\n  410 specifically for non-sync-token contexts.

This validates that Marketplace install can seamlessly hand off to the existing onboarding UX.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **Marketplace install handler**: An endpoint that receives the Marketplace install callback. Google sends the user to your app's URL after they click \"Install\" in the Marketplace. The callback includes the user's identity and granted scopes.\n\n2. **Install-to-onboarding bridge**: Parse the Marketplace callback, create (or find existing) user record, pre-connect their Google account using the Marketplace-granted OAuth tokens, and redirect to the Phase 6A onboarding page with the Google account already shown as connected.\n\n3. **Marketplace manifest**: The minimum viable listing configuration (app name, description, OAuth client ID, scopes, install URL, uninstall URL). This is a JSON/YAML config submitted to Google.\n\n## Architecture context\n- Marketplace install callback lands on oauth worker (or a new /marketplace/install endpoint)\n- Reuses existing AccountDO and OAuth token storage from TM-c40\n- Redirects to Phase 6A onboarding UI after pre-connecting Google account\n- Uninstall webhook will be handled in a later story\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Marketplace install callback, pre-authentication bridge, minimum listing config\n- OUT: Admin-level install, uninstall webhook, full listing metadata, OAuth verification process\n\n## Testing\n- Integration test: Marketplace install callback creates user and pre-connects Google account\n- Integration test: redirect to onboarding shows Google account as already connected\n- Unit test: Marketplace callback parameter parsing\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Marketplace install callback correctly parses user identity and OAuth tokens\n2. User record created (or existing user found) from Marketplace callback\n3.

{"id":"TM-ga8.2","title":"Google OAuth Verification \u0026 Consent Screen Polish","description":"Complete Google's OAuth verification process to remove the \"unverified app\" warning and present a branded consent screen. This is a prerequisite for Marketplace listing -- Google requires verified OAuth for all Marketplace apps. The verification process includes submitting a CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) for sensitive scopes like calendar access.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **OAuth consent screen configuration** in Google Cloud Console:\n   - App name: T-Minus\n   - App logo: T-Minus brand mark (hosted on accessible URL)\n   - App homepage: production URL\n   - Privacy policy URL: /legal/privacy\n   - Terms of service URL: /legal/terms\n   - Authorized domains: tminus.app (or chosen domain)\n   - Scopes: calendar.readonly, calendar.events, calendar.calendarlist.readonly\n\n2. **Privacy policy page** served by api worker:\n   - Data collected (calendar metadata, event titles/times/attendees)\n   - Data NOT collected (event content/attachments, non-calendar data)\n   - Data storage (encrypted, Cloudflare infrastructure, no third-party sharing)\n   - Data deletion (account disconnection removes all stored data)\n   - GDPR/CCPA compliance (right to erasure per TM-29q)\n\n3. **Terms of service page** served by api worker\n\n4. **CASA security assessment preparation**:\n   - Document data flow: user -\u003e Google OAuth -\u003e T-Minus -\u003e Cloudflare DO storage\n   - Document encryption: AES-256-GCM envelope encryption per AD-2\n   - Document access controls: per-user Durable Object isolation\n   - Prepare for Google's security questionnaire\n\n5. **OAuth verification submission** to Google:\n   - Submit consent screen for review\n   - Provide CASA documentation\n   - Respond to Google's review feedback\n\n## Business rules enforced\n- BR-1: Privacy policy accurately reflects actual data handling\n- BR-2: GDPR right to erasure (TM-29q) is implemented and documented\n- BR-3: Calendar scopes are minimal (no broader Google account access)\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Consent screen config, privacy policy, terms of service, CASA prep, verification submission\n- OUT: Actual CASA assessment execution (requires Google's third-party assessor), legal review of policy text\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: privacy policy page renders correctly\n- Unit test: terms of service page renders correctly\n- Integration test: OAuth consent screen shows T-Minus branding (in test mode)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. OAuth consent screen displays T-Minus logo, name, privacy policy, and terms of service URLs\n2. Privacy policy page is publicly accessible and accurately describes data handling\n3. Terms of service page is publicly accessible\n4. Requested scopes are minimal: calendar.readonly, calendar.events, calendar.calendarlist.readonly\n5.

This is documented in consent-screen.ts scopeJustifications. No Gmail, Drive, Contacts, or other Google service scopes are requested.\n\nNOTE on AC6: OAuth verification is an external Google process. The consent-screen.ts module provides the complete configuration (app name, logo, URLs, scopes, scope justifications) needed for submission via Google Cloud Console.

Restricted scopes (Gmail full, Drive full) require CASA assessment. Sensitive scopes require OAuth verification + consent screen review.\n- The marketplace manifest already defines legal URLs pointing to the OAuth worker ({baseUrl}/legal/privacy), so legal pages must be served from the OAuth worker, not the API worker.\n- T-Minus uses bidirectional sync, so calendar.readonly would be insufficient.

Use more specific pattern matching (e.g., check for \"admin_email LIKE\" before \"google_customer_id\").\n- Google Workspace admin install callback provides customer_id (organization identifier) vs individual install which provides state parameter.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [ISSUE] workers/api/src/governance-e2e.integration.test.ts: 3 pre-existing failures (expected 200, got 500) in AC#4, AC#5, AC#6. Not related to this story.\n- [CONCERN] Multiple integration test files use invalid Crockford Base32 ULID test IDs (24-char instead of 26-char). They work only because those handlers generate real IDs via generateId() rather than using the passed-in IDs directly.

Google sends uninstall webhooks for both individual and org-level uninstallations. Failure to handle these correctly results in stale tokens, orphaned data, and potential privacy violations.\n\n## What to implement\n\n1. **Uninstall webhook endpoint**: POST /marketplace/uninstall\n   - Receives Google's uninstall notification (signed JWT)\n   - Validates JWT signature against Google's public keys\n   - Extracts user or org identity\n\n2. **Individual uninstall**:\n   - Revoke OAuth tokens with Google (POST to accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke)\n   - Delete stored credentials from AccountDO\n   - Stop active sync for this account\n   - Optionally retain or delete synced event data (user preference if set, default: delete per GDPR)\n\n3. **Organization uninstall**:\n   - Iterate all users in the org\n   - Revoke tokens and delete credentials for each\n   - Remove organization record\n   - Stop all active syncs\n\n4. **Graceful handling**:\n   - Idempotent: re-processing the same uninstall webhook is safe\n   - Out-of-order: uninstall webhook arriving before install completes is handled\n   - Partial failure: if token revocation fails (e.g., token already expired), continue cleanup\n\n## Business rules enforced\n- BR-1: Credential deletion is mandatory on uninstall (GDPR, privacy policy)\n- BR-2: Token revocation with Google is best-effort (their API may fail)\n- BR-3: Uninstall is idempotent\n- BR-4: Audit log records uninstallation for compliance\n\n## Scope\n- IN: Uninstall webhook, token revocation, credential cleanup, org-level uninstall, idempotency\n- OUT: User data export before deletion (GDPR right to portability -- future), re-installation flow\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: JWT signature validation for Google's uninstall webhook\n- Unit test: idempotent uninstall (same webhook processed twice)\n- Integration test: individual uninstall revokes tokens and deletes credentials\n- Integration test: org uninstall processes all org users\n- Integration test: partial failure (token revocation fails) still completes credential cleanup\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Uninstall webhook validates Google's JWT signature\n2. Individual uninstall revokes OAuth tokens and deletes all stored credentials\n3. Organization uninstall processes all org users cleanly\n4. Uninstall is idempotent (duplicate webhooks handled safely)\n5. Partial failures (e.g., Google API down) do not block credential cleanup\n6.

{"id":"TM-hvg","title":"Implement policy compiler: BUSY/TITLE/FULL projection with stable hashing","description":"Implement the policy compiler as a pure function library in packages/shared/src/policy.ts. The compiler takes a canonical event + policy edge (detail_level, calendar_kind) and produces a deterministic ProjectedEvent payload. Stable hashing determines whether a write is needed.\n\n## What to implement\n\n### Projection logic (packages/shared/src/policy.ts)\n\n```typescript\nexport function compileProjection(\n  canonicalEvent: CanonicalEvent,\n  edge: PolicyEdge\n): ProjectedEvent {\n  const base = {\n    start: canonicalEvent.all_day\n      ? { date: canonicalEvent.start_ts.split('T')[0] }\n      : { dateTime: canonicalEvent.start_ts, timeZone: canonicalEvent.timezone || undefined },\n    end: canonicalEvent.all_day\n      ? { date: canonicalEvent.end_ts.split('T')[0] }\n      : { dateTime: canonicalEvent.end_ts, timeZone: canonicalEvent.timezone || undefined },\n    transparency: canonicalEvent.transparency,\n    extendedProperties: {\n      private: {\n        tminus: 'true' as const,\n        managed: 'true' as const,\n        canonical_event_id: canonicalEvent.canonical_event_id,\n        origin_account_id: canonicalEvent.origin_account_id,\n      },\n    },\n  };\n\n  switch (edge.detail_level) {\n    case 'BUSY':\n      return { ...base, summary: 'Busy', visibility: 'private' };\n    case 'TITLE':\n      return { ...base, summary: canonicalEvent.title || 'Busy', visibility: 'default' };\n    case 'FULL':\n      return {\n        ...base,\n        summary: canonicalEvent.title || 'Busy',\n        description: canonicalEvent.description || undefined,\n        location: canonicalEvent.location || undefined,\n        visibility: 'default',\n      };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Stable hashing (packages/shared/src/hash.ts)\n\n```typescript\n// Invariant C: Projections are deterministic\n// projected_hash = SHA-256(canonical_event_id + detail_level + calendar_kind + sorted relevant fields)\nexport async function computeProjectionHash(\n  canonicalEventId: string,\n  detailLevel: DetailLevel,\n  calendarKind: CalendarKind,\n  projection: ProjectedEvent\n): Promise\u003cstring\u003e {\n  // Deterministic serialization: sort keys, normalize values\n  // Use crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', ...)\n}\n```\n\n### Idempotency key generation\n\n```typescript\n// Invariant D: Idempotency everywhere\nexport function computeIdempotencyKey(\n  canonicalEventId: string,\n  targetAccountId: string,\n  projectedHash: string\n): string {\n  // hash(canonical_event_id + target_account_id + projected_hash)\n}\n```\n\n## Business rules enforced\n\n- BR-3: Projections are deterministic.

{"id":"TM-kw7","title":"Implement D1 registry schema and migrations","description":"Create the D1 registry database schema and migration files. D1 is the cross-user lookup database -- it handles routing, identity, and compliance. It is NOT on the hot sync path.\n\n## What to implement\n\nCreate migration files in a migrations/ directory (used by wrangler d1 migrations apply).\n\n### Migration 0001: Initial schema\n\n\\`\\`\\`sql\n-- Organization registry\nCREATE TABLE orgs (\n  org_id       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- ULID\n  name         TEXT NOT NULL,\n  created_at   TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),\n  updated_at   TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))\n);\n\n-- User registry\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  user_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- ULID\n  org_id       TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES orgs(org_id),\n  email        TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n  display_name TEXT,\n  created_at   TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))\n);\n\n-- External account registry (webhook routing + OAuth callback)\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n  account_id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- ULID\n  user_id              TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),\n  provider             TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'google',\n  provider_subject     TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Google sub claim\n  email                TEXT NOT NULL,\n  status               TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',  -- active | revoked | error\n  channel_id           TEXT,           -- current watch channel UUID\n  channel_token        TEXT,           -- secret token for webhook validation (X-Goog-Channel-Token)\n  channel_expiry_ts    TEXT,\n  created_at           TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),\n  UNIQUE(provider, provider_subject)\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_accounts_user ON accounts(user_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_accounts_channel ON accounts(channel_id);\n\n-- Deletion certificates (GDPR/CCPA proof)\nCREATE TABLE deletion_certificates (\n  cert_id       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n  entity_type   TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'user' | 'account' | 'event'\n  entity_id     TEXT NOT NULL,\n  deleted_at    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),\n  proof_hash    TEXT NOT NULL,  -- SHA-256 of deleted data summary\n  signature     TEXT NOT NULL   -- system signature\n);\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## IMPORTANT: channel_token column\n\nThe accounts table MUST include a channel_token column. This stores the secret token generated during watch channel registration and echoed back by Google in the X-Goog-Channel-Token header on every push notification. The webhook-worker validates this token on every incoming notification per ARCHITECTURE.md Section 8.2.\n\nWithout this column, webhook validation cannot verify the authenticity of incoming notifications.\n\n## Why D1 (not DO SQLite) for registry\n\nPer ADR-1: D1 handles ONLY cross-user lookups. The webhook-worker needs to look up which user owns a channel_id to route sync messages. The oauth-worker needs to check if a provider_subject is already linked. These are cross-user queries that cannot live in per-user DOs.\n\n## Why deletion certificates\n\nGDPR/CCPA requires ability to prove what was deleted and when. The deletion_certificates table stores entity_type, entity_id, proof_hash, signature.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Integration test: migration applies successfully to D1\n- Integration test: INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE on all tables work\n- Integration test: UNIQUE constraints are enforced (provider, provider_subject)\n- Integration test: Foreign key constraints work (user_id references)\n- Integration test: channel_token column is writable and queryable\n- Unit test: Migration SQL is valid","acceptance_criteria":"1.

{"id":"TM-nfm","title":"Fix cron worker non-handler constant export breaking wrangler dev","description":"## What\n\nThe cron worker at `workers/cron/src/index.ts` exports non-function constants at the module level:\n- `CRON_CHANNEL_RENEWAL` (string)\n- `CRON_TOKEN_HEALTH` (string)\n- `CRON_RECONCILIATION` (string)\n- `CHANNEL_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_MS` (number)\n- `MS_SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_MS` (number)\n\nWrangler dev interprets ALL named exports from the entry module as handler entries (it builds a map of exports expecting functions or ExportedHandler types). When it encounters a number or string export, it throws:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Incorrect type for map entry 'CHANNEL_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_MS':\nthe provided value is not of type 'function or ExportedHandler'\n```\n\nThis prevents the cron worker from starting under wrangler dev entirely, which blocks all 7 credential-gated cron real integration tests.\n\n## Why\n\nThe cron worker is responsible for 4 critical maintenance jobs: Google channel renewal, Microsoft subscription renewal, token health checks, and drift reconciliation (per ADR-6: daily, not weekly). If wrangler dev cannot start the worker, none of these can be tested against real infrastructure. Additionally, this same issue would occur in production deployment if wrangler encounters the same export validation.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWrangler expects the entry module to only export:\n1. A default export (the handler/ExportedHandler)\n2. Named exports that are Durable Object classes or Workflow classes\n\nNon-handler exports (plain constants) cause a TypeError. The mocked integration tests never start wrangler dev (they import the handler directly via vitest), so this was never caught.\n\n## How to Fix\n\n1. Create a new file: `workers/cron/src/constants.ts`\n2. Move ALL non-handler constants from `workers/cron/src/index.ts` to `workers/cron/src/constants.ts`:\n   - `CRON_CHANNEL_RENEWAL`\n   - `CRON_TOKEN_HEALTH`\n   - `CRON_RECONCILIATION`\n   - `CHANNEL_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_MS`\n   - `MS_SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_MS`\n3. In `workers/cron/src/index.ts`:\n   - Import the constants from `./constants.ts` (internal import, NOT re-export)\n   - Remove the `export` keyword from all constant declarations\n   - Keep the `export default handler` and `export { ReconcileWorkflow }` and `export function createHandler()` -- these are valid handler/class exports\n4. Update ALL files that import these constants from `./index.ts` or `./index.js`:\n   - `workers/cron/src/cron.integration.test.ts` -- change import to `./constants.js`\n   - `workers/cron/src/cron.real.integration.test.ts` -- change import to `./constants.js`\n   - Any other test files that reference these constants\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `workers/cron/src/index.ts` -- Remove constant exports, import from `./constants`\n- `workers/cron/src/constants.ts` -- NEW FILE: all cron constants\n- `workers/cron/src/cron.integration.test.ts` -- Update import paths\n- `workers/cron/src/cron.real.integration.test.ts` -- Update import paths (currently imports from `../../../scripts/test/integration-helpers.js` but references constants like CRON_CHANNEL_RENEWAL inline; verify if it imports from index)\n\n## Current Module Exports (workers/cron/src/index.ts)\n\nThe file currently exports:\n```typescript\nexport { ReconcileWorkflow } from \"@tminus/workflow-reconcile\";  // OK: class export\nexport const CRON_CHANNEL_RENEWAL = \"0 */6 * * *\";              // BAD: string\nexport const CRON_TOKEN_HEALTH = \"0 */12 * * *\";                // BAD: string\nexport const CRON_RECONCILIATION = \"0 3 * * *\";                 // BAD: string\nexport const CHANNEL_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // BAD: number\nexport const MS_SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD_MS = 54 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // BAD: number\nexport function createHandler() { ... }                          // OK: function\nexport default handler;                                          // OK: handler\n```\n\nAfter the fix, `workers/cron/src/index.ts` should only export:\n```typescript\nexport { ReconcileWorkflow } from \"@tminus/workflow-reconcile\";  // class\nexport function createHandler() { ... }                          // function\nexport default handler;                                          // handler\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `wrangler dev --config workers/cron/wrangler.toml` starts without TypeError\n2. The /health endpoint responds with 200 OK when accessed via HTTP\n3. The `/__scheduled?cron=0 */6 * * *` endpoint completes without crash\n4. All 10 cron real integration tests pass (`make test-integration-real` filtered to cron tests)\n5. All existing mocked cron integration tests continue to pass (`pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-cron test`)\n6. Constants remain accessible via `import { CRON_CHANNEL_RENEWAL } from './constants.js'` for tests\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- **Unit tests**: Verify constants are importable from `./constants.ts` with correct values\n- **Integration tests (mocked)**: Existing cron.integration.test.ts must pass with updated import paths\n- **Integration tests (real)**: All 10 tests in cron.real.integration.test.ts must pass, including:\n  - Starting wrangler dev successfully\n  - Health endpoint returning 200\n  - All 3 cron patterns completing without crash\n  - Unknown cron pattern handled gracefully\n\n## MANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified.

{"id":"TM-swj","title":"Refactor to provider-agnostic interfaces","description":"Before adding Microsoft support, refactor the codebase to use provider-agnostic interfaces where Google-specific code is currently hardcoded. This is the prerequisite for multi-provider support.\n\n## What to refactor\n\n### 1. CalendarProvider interface (packages/shared/src/provider.ts -- new)\nExtract from GoogleCalendarClient into a generic interface:\n\ninterface CalendarProvider {\n  listCalendars(): Promise\u003cCalendarListEntry[]\u003e\n  listEvents(calendarId: string, options: ListEventsOptions): Promise\u003cListEventsResponse\u003e\n  insertEvent(calendarId: string, event: EventPayload): Promise\u003cInsertedEvent\u003e\n  patchEvent(calendarId: string, eventId: string, patch: EventPatch): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  deleteEvent(calendarId: string, eventId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  createCalendar(name: string): Promise\u003cCreatedCalendar\u003e\n  watchEvents(calendarId: string, webhookUrl: string): Promise\u003cWatchResponse\u003e\n  stopWatch(channelId: string, resourceId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n}\n\nGoogleCalendarClient already implements most of this. Make it explicit.\n\n### 2. Provider type on AccountDO\nAccountDO currently assumes Google. Add a provider field:\n- accounts table in D1: ADD COLUMN provider TEXT DEFAULT 'google'\n- AccountDO auth table: store provider type\n- AccountDO methods: route to correct provider based on type\n\n### 3. Normalization abstraction\nCurrently: normalizeGoogleEvent() -\u003e ProviderDelta\nNeed: normalizeProviderEvent(provider: string, rawEvent: unknown) -\u003e ProviderDelta\nGoogle normalization stays as-is. Microsoft normalization added in later story.\n\n### 4. Event classification\nclassifyEvent() uses Google-specific extended properties (tminus=true, managed=true).\nMicrosoft equivalent: open extensions or single-value extended properties.\nRefactor classifyEvent() to accept a ClassificationStrategy that knows how to check for managed markers per provider.\n\n### 5. Webhook identification\nCurrently webhook-worker only handles Google push notifications (X-Goog-Channel-ID).\nNeed: route to provider-specific handler based on request path or headers.\n- POST /webhook/google -\u003e Google handler (existing)\n- POST /webhook/microsoft -\u003e Microsoft handler (new, later story)\n\n### 6. D1 registry schema update\nAdd provider column to accounts table:\nALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN provider TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'google';\n\n## Files to modify\n- packages/shared/src/google-api.ts (extract CalendarProvider interface)\n- packages/shared/src/provider.ts (new -- provider interface + factory)\n- packages/shared/src/normalize.ts (add provider dispatch)\n- packages/shared/src/classify.ts (add ClassificationStrategy)\n- packages/shared/src/index.ts (re-export new types)\n- packages/d1-registry/migrations/ (add provider column migration)\n- durable-objects/account/src/index.ts (add provider field)\n- workers/webhook/src/index.ts (add route-based provider dispatch)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests for provider interface compliance (GoogleCalendarClient satisfies CalendarProvider)\n- Unit tests for provider dispatch in normalization\n- Existing tests must still pass unchanged (Google is the default)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. CalendarProvider interface defined and GoogleCalendarClient implements it\n2. AccountDO stores provider type (default: 'google')\n3. D1 accounts table has provider column\n4. normalizeProviderEvent dispatches by provider (Google only for now)\n5. classifyEvent accepts provider-specific classification strategy\n6.

{"id":"TM-xpo","title":"Fix per-project test:integration scripts using Jest flags instead of Vitest","description":"## What\n\nAll per-project `package.json` files have `test:integration` scripts that use `--testPathPattern`, which is a Jest CLI flag. T-Minus uses Vitest, not Jest. The correct Vitest equivalent varies by version but the scripts are non-functional as written. Additionally, the Makefile's `test-integration` target has already been updated to use `vitest.integration.config.ts`, but the per-project scripts remain broken.\n\nCurrent broken scripts:\n\n- `workers/cron/package.json`: `\"test:integration\": \"vitest run --testPathPattern='integration'\"`\n- `workers/sync-consumer/package.json`: `\"test:integration\": \"vitest run --testPathPattern=integration\"`\n- `workers/write-consumer/package.json`: `\"test:integration\": \"vitest run --testPathPattern='integration\\\\.test'\"`\n\nThese flags are silently ignored by Vitest (it does not error on unknown flags; it just runs ALL tests), meaning `pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-cron test:integration` would run all tests, not just integration tests.\n\n## Why\n\nConsistent test infrastructure is essential for developer productivity and CI reliability. If per-project `test:integration` scripts do not correctly filter to integration tests, developers get misleading results. The root-level Makefile targets work correctly but the per-project scripts are the expected way to run tests for a single worker during development.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe scripts were written with Jest syntax during initial scaffolding. When the project migrated to Vitest, the scripts were not updated. Vitest does not have a `--testPathPattern` flag; it uses positional arguments or `--include` patterns.\n\n## How to Fix\n\nFor each worker's `package.json`, update the `test:integration` script. Vitest supports glob/file arguments or `include` config.\n\n**Option A (recommended): Use Vitest's `include` via CLI**\n\n```json\n\"test:integration\": \"vitest run --include='**/*.integration.test.ts'\"\n```\n\n**Option B: Point to a dedicated integration config**\n\nEach worker could have a `vitest.integration.config.ts` that includes only integration test files. However, this is heavier than needed for per-project use.\n\n**Option C: Use positional file glob**\n\n```json\n\"test:integration\": \"vitest run 'src/**/*.integration.test.ts'\"\n```\n\nVerify which approach works with the project's Vitest version (^3.0.0).\n\n### Files to Update\n\n1. `workers/cron/package.json` -- Fix `test:integration` script\n2. `workers/sync-consumer/package.json` -- Fix `test:integration` script\n3. `workers/write-consumer/package.json` -- Fix `test:integration` script\n4. `workers/api/package.json` -- Check and fix if same issue exists\n5. `workers/oauth/package.json` -- Check and fix if same issue exists\n6. `workers/webhook/package.json` -- Check and fix if same issue exists\n\nAdditionally, check all other workspace packages:\n- `packages/shared/package.json`\n- `packages/d1-registry/package.json`\n- `durable-objects/account/package.json`\n- `durable-objects/user-graph/package.json`\n- `workflows/onboarding/package.json`\n- `workflows/reconcile/package.json`\n\n### Vitest Configuration Context\n\nThe project already has these root-level Vitest configs:\n- `vitest.integration.config.ts` -- Mocked integration tests (used by `make test-integration`)\n- `vitest.integration.real.config.ts` -- Real API integration tests (used by `make test-integration-real`)\n- `vitest.e2e.config.ts` -- E2E tests (used by `make test-e2e`)\n\nPer-project configs are in `workers/*/vitest.config.ts` and are used by the default `test` and `test:unit` scripts.\n\n### Test Script Naming Convention\n\nEnsure consistency across all packages:\n- `test` -- Run all tests (unit + mocked integration)\n- `test:unit` -- Run only unit tests\n- `test:integration` -- Run only mocked integration tests (matching `*.integration.test.ts`)\n\nReal integration tests (`*.real.integration.test.ts`) and E2E tests are ONLY run via root-level Makefile targets because they require credentials and wrangler dev.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-cron run test:integration` runs ONLY `*.integration.test.ts` files (not unit tests, not real integration tests)\n2. `pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-sync-consumer run test:integration` runs ONLY integration tests\n3. `pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-write-consumer run test:integration` runs ONLY integration tests\n4. All other workspace packages with `test:integration` scripts are fixed\n5. The `test:unit` scripts do NOT run integration tests\n6. The existing Makefile targets (`make test-integration`, `make test-integration-real`, `make test-e2e`) continue to work unchanged\n7. All 381 existing tests continue to pass with no regressions\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- **Verification**: Run each per-project `test:integration` script and verify only integration test files are executed (check vitest output for file list)\n- **Verification**: Run each per-project `test:unit` script and verify integration test files are NOT executed\n- **Verification**: Run `make test-integration` and verify it still works correctly via the root-level config\n- **Integration tests (mocked)**: All 381 tests pass\n\n## MANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified. Standard Vitest CLI configuration. No specialized skill requirements.","notes":"DELIVERED:\n- CI Results: test PASS (544 unit tests across 7 packages), test-integration PASS (386 integration tests across 13 files)\n- Wiring: N/A -- this story only modifies package.json scripts (no new functions/middleware to wire)\n- Coverage: N/A -- no new code, only script configuration changes\n- Commit: 4a79fde pushed to origin/beads-sync\n- Test Output:\n\n  Per-project test:integration verification (all 12 packages):\n  - @tminus/worker-cron:           24 tests PASS (cron.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/worker-sync-consumer:  31 tests PASS (sync-consumer.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/worker-write-consumer: 53 tests PASS (3 integration files, no unit/real files)\n  - @tminus/worker-api:            27 tests PASS (index.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/worker-oauth:           0 tests PASS (--passWithNoTests, only has real integration)\n  - @tminus/worker-webhook:        13 tests PASS (webhook.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/shared:                29 tests PASS (schema.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/d1-registry:           34 tests PASS (schema.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/do-account:            58 tests PASS (account-do.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/do-user-graph:         87 tests PASS (user-graph-do.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/workflow-onboarding:   16 tests PASS (onboarding.integration.test.ts only)\n  - @tminus/workflow-reconcile:    14 tests PASS (reconcile.integration.test.ts only)\n\n  make test-integration: 386 tests, 13 files PASS (unchanged behavior)\n  make test (full unit suite): 544 tests PASS (no regressions)\n\nAC Verification:\n| AC # | Requirement | Code Location | Test Location | Status |\n|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| 1 | cron test:integration runs ONLY *.integration.test.ts | workers/cron/package.json:10 | pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-cron run test:integration -\u003e 24 tests, 1 file (cron.integration.test.ts) | PASS |\n| 2 | sync-consumer test:integration runs ONLY integration tests | workers/sync-consumer/package.json:10 | pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-sync-consumer run test:integration -\u003e 31 tests | PASS |\n| 3 | write-consumer test:integration runs ONLY integration tests | workers/write-consumer/package.json:10 | pnpm --filter @tminus/worker-write-consumer run test:integration -\u003e 53 tests, 3 files | PASS |\n| 4 | All other workspace packages with test:integration scripts are fixed | All 12 package.json files | Each verified individually (see per-project results above) | PASS |\n| 5 | test:unit scripts do NOT run integration tests | Per-project vitest.config.ts exclude patterns | Verified: cron=0 unit tests (passWithNoTests), write-consumer=16, shared=399, d1-registry=8, do-account=14, do-user-graph=0 (passWithNoTests) | PASS |\n| 6 | Makefile targets continue working unchanged | Makefile:18 (pre-existing fix included) | make test-integration -\u003e 386 tests PASS | PASS |\n| 7 | All 381 existing tests continue to pass | N/A | 386 integration + 544 unit = 930 total tests PASS | PASS |\n\nAPPROACH: Used `vitest run --root ../.. --config vitest.integration.config.ts --passWithNoTests '\u003cpath-filter\u003e'` pattern. The --root ../.. resolves to workspace root, --config points to the root-level integration config (which includes *.integration.test.ts and excludes *.real.integration.test.ts), and the positional argument filters to only the specific package's directory. This reuses the existing root integration config rather than creating 12 per-project configs.\n\nAlso fixed test:unit scripts in 5 packages (write-consumer, shared, d1-registry, do-account, do-user-graph) that used Jest flags (--testPathPattern, --testPathIgnorePatterns). Replaced with simple `vitest run` or `vitest run --passWithNoTests` since per-project vitest.config.ts already excludes integration tests via its include/exclude patterns.\n\nLEARNINGS:\n- Vitest 3.2.4 errors on unknown CLI flags (CACError: Unknown option). The story described them as \"silently ignored\" which was true in earlier Vitest versions but not in 3.x. The scripts were actively broken (exit code 1), not just silently wrong.\n- Vitest has no --include CLI flag (only a config option). The --exclude flag is available but cannot override config-level excludes. Positional filter args work but are filtered AFTER config include/exclude, so they cannot include files that the config excludes.\n- The --root flag changes Vitest's working directory, and --config is resolved relative to that root. Order matters: `--root ../.. --config vitest.integration.config.ts` resolves config from root, while `--config ../../vitest.integration.config.ts --root ../..` would resolve config from CWD then change root.\n- All workspace packages are exactly 2 levels deep (workers/*, packages/*, durable-objects/*, workflows/*) so ../.. universally reaches root.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [INFO] workers/oauth has no mocked integration tests (only real integration tests). The test:integration script correctly passes with --passWithNoTests.\n- [INFO] workers/cron, workers/sync-consumer, durable-objects/user-graph, workflows/onboarding, workflows/reconcile have no unit test files. Their test:unit scripts use --passWithNoTests which is correct but means `make test` shows 0 tests for these packages.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ramxx@ramirosalas.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T15:26:39.102123-08:00","created_by":"RamXX","updated_at":"2026-02-14T16:17:28.708383-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T16:17:28.708383-08:00","close_reason":"Accepted: All 12 workspace package.json test:integration scripts fixed to use Vitest-compatible syntax.

{"id":"TM-yhf","title":"Walking skeleton: minimal webhook-to-busy-overlay pipeline","description":"Wire the thinnest possible end-to-end flow proving all layers integrate: a Google Calendar webhook triggers sync-queue -\u003e sync-consumer -\u003e UserGraphDO -\u003e write-queue -\u003e write-consumer -\u003e busy overlay event created in a second account.\n\n## What to implement\n\nThis story WIRES existing components from other epics into a working pipeline. It does not build the components themselves -- it integrates them.\n\n### Pre-requisites (components built in other stories)\n\n- Monorepo structure (TM-m08)\n- Shared types (TM-dep)\n- Wrangler configs (TM-ec3)\n- D1 schema (TM-kw7)\n- AccountDO (TM-ckt)\n- Policy compiler (TM-hvg)\n- Event classification (TM-5lq)\n- Google API client (TM-j11)\n- UserGraphDO (TM-q6w)\n- Webhook worker (TM-50t)\n- Sync-consumer (TM-9w7)\n- Write-consumer (TM-7i5)\n\n### What this story does\n\n1. Deploy all workers with correct bindings to a dev environment (or local via miniflare)\n2. Create test data: two Google accounts with tokens in AccountDO, policy edges between them, D1 registry entries\n3. Simulate (or trigger) a webhook notification for Account A\n4. Verify the full pipeline executes: webhook -\u003e sync-queue -\u003e sync-consumer -\u003e UserGraphDO -\u003e write-queue -\u003e write-consumer -\u003e Google Calendar API\n5. Verify a Busy block appears in Account B's 'External Busy' overlay calendar\n6. Verify event_mirrors shows state=ACTIVE\n7. Verify event_journal has entries for the operation\n\n### Test scenario\n\nUsing two test Google Calendar accounts:\n1. Account A has an event 'Board Meeting, 2pm-3pm'\n2. Policy edge: A -\u003e B, detail_level=BUSY, calendar_kind=BUSY_OVERLAY\n3. Trigger incremental sync for Account A\n4. Verify: Account B has 'Busy' event 2pm-3pm in 'External Busy' calendar\n5. Verify: extendedProperties on B's event have tminus=true, managed=true\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Full pipeline executes without errors from webhook to busy overlay creation\n2. Busy block appears in the correct calendar with correct time\n3. Extended properties present on managed event (loop prevention)\n4. Event journal records the sync operation\n5. Mirror state is ACTIVE\n6. No sync loops (creating the mirror does not trigger a new sync cycle)\n\n## Testing\n\n- Integration test: full pipeline with real Cloudflare runtime (vitest-pool-workers)\n- Integration test: verify event appears in target account's overlay calendar\n- Integration test: verify no sync loop by checking journal for spurious entries\n\nMANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- None identified. Integration wiring of existing components.","acceptance_criteria":"1. Webhook triggers full pipeline to busy overlay creation\n2. Busy block has correct time, summary='Busy'\n3.

UserGraphDO.handleUpdated internally upserts by calling handleCreated when the event doesn't exist. The ApplyResult counts this as \"updated\" not \"created\" -- test assertions must check created+updated.\n- The sync-\u003easync bridge for DO-backed MirrorStore required a cached proxy pattern: pre-fetch state before WriteConsumer.processMessage(), buffer writes during processing, flush to DO after completion. This is necessary because WriteConsumer's MirrorStore interface is synchronous (designed for direct SQLite access) but DO communication is async.\n- UserGraphDO and AccountDO each need a handleFetch() method that routes by URL pathname. This is the validated DO RPC pattern for Cloudflare Durable Objects -- workers call stub.fetch(new Request(url, {body})) and the DO routes by pathname.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [ISSUE] TM-4r0 and TM-g4r are now resolved by this story: both fetch handlers and mirror state RPC methods were added here.\n- [CONCERN] The DOBackedMirrorStore has a limitation: it can only serve one canonical_event_id per message processing cycle. This is fine for the current queue-message-per-mirror design, but if batching multiple mirrors per message is added later, the caching strategy needs expansion.\n- [CONCERN] No remote repository is configured for git push.

{"id":"TM-z4q","title":"Deletion Request API Endpoint","description":"API endpoint for user to request full account deletion (GDPR Right to Erasure).\n\nWHAT TO IMPLEMENT:\n1. workers/api/src/routes/privacy.ts:\n   - POST /v1/account/delete-request: authenticated endpoint. User confirms deletion intent (requires re-authentication with password). Creates deletion_requests row in D1 with status 'pending', scheduled_at (72h grace period for cancellation).\n   - DELETE /v1/account/delete-request: cancel pending deletion (within 72h grace period).\n   - GET /v1/account/delete-request: check deletion request status.\n2. D1 migration: deletion_requests table (request_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, user_id TEXT, status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('pending','processing','completed','cancelled')), requested_at TEXT, scheduled_at TEXT, completed_at TEXT).\n3. Grace period: 72 hours from request to execution. User can cancel during this window.\n4. After grace period: trigger DeletionWorkflow (implemented in next story).\n5. Cron trigger: cron-worker checks for pending deletions past scheduled_at, triggers DeletionWorkflow.\n\nARCHITECTURE: Envelope response format. Auth middleware required. User can only delete their own account.\nBUSINESS: GDPR Article 17 requires deletion within 30 days. 72h grace period is well within that window.\n\nScope: API endpoint + D1 schema + cron trigger only. The actual cascading deletion logic is in the DeletionWorkflow story.\n\nTESTING:\n- Unit tests (vitest): route handler validation, grace period logic, cancellation logic.\n- Integration tests (vitest pool workers): create deletion request, verify D1 row, cancel within grace period, verify cancelled. Create request past grace period, verify cron triggers workflow.\n- No E2E required (covered by GDPR E2E story).\n\nMANDATORY SKILLS TO REVIEW:\n- Cloudflare Workers D1 migration patterns.\n- Cloudflare Workers Cron Trigger patterns.","acceptance_criteria":"1.

When binding is not configured, the cron handler still marks requests as 'processing' but logs a warning. The actual DeletionWorkflow is implemented in TM-ufm (next story).\n\nLEARNINGS:\n- The API worker uses direct handler functions (not Hono sub-routers) for authenticated routes. Auth context is passed via function parameters, not Hono middleware variables. This is more consistent with the existing pattern.\n- D1 migration for deletion_requests uses a CHECK constraint on status column to enforce valid status transitions at the database level, preventing invalid states even if application logic has bugs.\n\nOBSERVATIONS (unrelated to this task):\n- [ISSUE] packages/shared/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts:361: Pre-existing TypeScript error. Property 'body' does not exist on type 'Response'. This blocks lint/build but not test execution.\n- [CONCERN] workers/cron wrangler.toml: The CRON_DELETION_CHECK schedule (\"0 * * * *\") needs to be added to wrangler.toml [triggers].crons for the cron worker.
